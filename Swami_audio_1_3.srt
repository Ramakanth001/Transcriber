00:01:30 --> 00:01:52
 So, therefore, due to that vyaamoha, that personal attraction, personal relationship, just like selecting somebody who is related in an interview, the expert, his relative is there as a candidate, then he will select the candidate.

5
00:01:52 --> 00:02:10
 He will argue, he is the best candidate. What answer he has given, that he is present in the research. Not in the syllabus, but latest papers have come on that. He is very advanced to it, because he is related.

6
00:02:10 --> 00:02:22
 If he is outsider, if he is not related to him, he will say, no, he has given wrong answer. So, this partiality, this partiality is there.

7
00:02:22 --> 00:02:42
 So, that is why he, in fact, Arjuna came to fight for his share. It is actually pruruti. Of course, he is justified pruruti, not dushpruruti, because he came for his right way share.

8
00:02:42 --> 00:02:57
 For unjust thing, he did not come. Right way prapati he came, share. So, he comes under pruruti. Pruruti means justice, vote for justice against injustice.

9
00:02:57 --> 00:03:16
 Then Krishna told, Krishna grasped this point, that this fellow is leaving even that, sacrificing that share for the sake of his grandfather, for the sake of his bond with grandfather.

10
00:03:16 --> 00:03:32
 That is the real secret. And he is talking all nonsense, just covering the fact. Krishna also did not point out that actual fact.

11
00:03:32 --> 00:03:45
 That fellow, since your grandfather is there, you are stopping from fighting. That he did not tell in Bhagavad Gita, because he kept it secret and told everything else.

12
00:03:45 --> 00:04:03
 Krishna also, since he did not tell it outside, he did not tell that point anywhere in Gita. What he told, he came from another side. I am God. My work is to destroy injustice and establish justice.

13
00:04:03 --> 00:04:21
 Pandavas are on the side of justice. You enter nivruti, then you are the servant of God. You have cut all your worldly bonds. All your worldly bonds are destroyed.

14
00:04:21 --> 00:04:32
 When he said all the worldly bonds are destroyed, the bond with Bhishma also must be destroyed. Indirectly he is telling that. He knows that he has cut the point. He indicated that.

15
00:04:32 --> 00:04:48
 But as nivruti, as servant of God, to help in establishing justice, to help in condemning injustice, you fought on my behalf as my servant. He brought another strategy.

16
00:04:48 --> 00:05:03
 This fellow brought some other strategy to cover his point. God also did not open that issue. He also kept silent on that. He brought another strategy.

17
00:05:03 --> 00:05:19
 He brought another strategy. I am God. You are soul. So God's work, you must help God's program. Then only God will be pleased with you.

18
00:05:19 --> 00:05:35
 So like that he brought nivruti topic. Therefore you fight. You fight as my servant. In my work you are participating as my servant. It is not your work.

19
00:05:35 --> 00:05:48
 Otherwise you don't want your share. You don't want to fight. Okay. I agree. Don't fight on that issue, on that ground. But fight on other ground.

20
00:05:48 --> 00:06:05
 I am God. You are soul. You must be servant to me. This is my work. This is not your work. And moreover, even if you don't fight, don't think that the war will stop. They will be killed by me.

21
00:06:05 --> 00:06:26
 I am going to kill them. Already the time has come. I have decided to kill them. You just stand only as an external outside fellow. It is my work. If you are not helping me, I will do my work.

22
00:06:26 --> 00:06:43
 Am I inefficient to do my work? I can do my work and I can also help you in your work. You can neither do your work nor how. How can you help my work? Okay.

23
00:06:43 --> 00:06:58
 So if you help my work, then I will grace you. You will be benefited. If you don't help my work, even then I will do my work. Even then I am going to kill your godfather.

24
00:06:58 --> 00:07:24
 I have already killed them. These people who are standing against you, they are only dead bodies. They have no life. I have already taken their life. You are only killing the dead bodies. That's all.

25
00:07:24 --> 00:07:40
 Like that, he went to Nivruthi and made him fight. Then he thought, even if I withdraw, my grandfather is going to die. And by that I will lose also. I will not get salvation.

26
00:07:40 --> 00:07:55
 Anyway he is going to die. Let me kill and get salvation. See, anything is going to happen. Why not I get benefit? Why should I lose?

27
00:07:55 --> 00:08:19
 So like that, it was Krishna emphasized in Gita that you fight like my servant to help my program. He fought. Krishna never asked, I will help you. I will kill all of them.

28
00:08:19 --> 00:08:40
 So at least in your share, give me some share to me also. He never asked in Gita. He only asked you killing justice and establishing justice. That is my work. You help my work. Since I am helping you, give some share to me. He never asked like that.

29
00:08:40 --> 00:08:55
 If we are there in the place of Krishna, we will ask him. At least you fought, you are fighting only for 50% of the share. The other 50% give to me since I am helping you.

30
00:08:55 --> 00:09:14
 We say that Arjuna, since Lord Krishna asked him to kill his grandfather, can we say it was a test for Arjuna?

31
00:09:14 --> 00:09:39
 See, test for Arjuna, if you take a test for Arjuna, Arjuna failed in that test. See Arjuna took two births afterwards as the hunter and Swami Vivekananda. He did not get salvation in that birth itself.

32
00:09:39 --> 00:10:00
 So even before testing, Arjuna showed he will fail you in that concept. See when he is telling that I will not kill Bhishma, will you kill Bhishma or not for my sake?
