## Introduction

The **Transcriber** project includes a variety of modules, with the core functionality centered around Speech-to-Text (STS) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) operations. The project is designed to support both the transcription of speech into text and the conversion of text into synthesized speech, offering the flexibility to manipulate audio and video files.

Key functionalities include:
- Speech-to-text (STS) conversion
- Text-to-speech (TTS) conversion - in_progress
- Video splitting (with and without compression)
- Video-to-audio conversion

## Requirements

Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### FFmpeg Installation

**FFmpeg** is required for video and audio processing.

#### On Windows:
1. Go to [FFmpeg Builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
2. Select the master build `ffmpeg-git-full.7z`.
3. Download, extract it, and note the path to the `bin` folder that contains `ffmpeg.exe` (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg-2024-09-26-git-full_build\bin`).
4. Add this path to your environment variables (system path):

   ```bash
   setx /m PATH "C:\ffmpeg\ffmpeg-2024-09-26-git-f43916e217-full_build\bin\;%PATH%"
   ```

5. Restart your PC and verify FFmpeg installation by running:

   ```bash
   where ffmpeg
   ```

#### On WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

Note: WSL requires an additional 250 MB of space.
