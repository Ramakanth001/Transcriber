1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:12
 is very secret. It is not a public topic because if I take somebody's sin, punishment and undergo

2
00:00:12 --> 00:00:25
 the punishment, it is based on my love to that devotee. Now how you can snatch that?

3
00:00:25 --> 00:00:35
 Due to my love, I am undergoing the punishment. Is it justified for you to ask a share from

4
00:00:35 --> 00:00:42
 it? Somebody has given me a poison due to love. I am eating. You are asking share from

5
00:00:42 --> 00:00:54
 it? He has more love on me. Then you become more real devotee. You improve

6
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
 your devotion. You become more real devotee. You become more real devotee. You become more

7
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
 devotion. You become more and more real devotee so that I can also take that poison from you

8
00:01:00 --> 00:01:13
 also. Giving poison is your duty. Eating poison is my duty. So moreover, that is a very secret

9
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
 topic that is generally not opened. Rama, Krishna also, they also underwent those things

10
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
 but never that aspect was opened. Only Dattavataras, Shirdi Sai Baba.

11
00:01:25 --> 00:01:32
 And all these Avataraas, only that topic was opened. Otherwise it is a secret topic because

12
00:01:32 --> 00:01:41
 if I undergo the punishment of the sin of my real devotee and make him know that I have

13
00:01:41 --> 00:01:49
 undergone the punishment of the devotee of, punishment of that devotee, it is not a real love.

14
00:01:49 --> 00:01:55
 Advertisement should not be done. Secretly it should be done. Secretly it should be done.

15
00:01:55 --> 00:02:05
 Then he will become grateful to me. That is again business devotion. Is it not? So it

16
00:02:05 --> 00:02:18
 is without very top secret, it is highly secret. The devotee whom I love, I will take the pain,

17
00:02:18 --> 00:02:24
 the punishment. All are not of that status. All are not real devotees also. So, I am not

18
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
 doing the work. So, I will take the pain, the punishment. All are not real devotees also.

19
00:02:26 --> 00:02:37
 Some people for their solutions of their worldly problems, they come to God, is not. So, that

20
00:02:37 --> 00:02:46
 should not be exposed. That should not be advertised. That should not be made public.

21
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
 It is sanctity will be lost. And this aspect is made public because that is a public being.

22
00:02:51 --> 00:02:52
 Yes, yes.

23
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
 So, the point is that, this is the main point. The point is that, this is the main point.

24
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
 That is the main point. So, the point is that, this is the main point. So, if you are ready to come

25
00:02:54 --> 00:03:04
 public by me also several times only to you see i took the responsibility of

26
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
 propagating the true and complete spiritual knowledge

27
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
 this also is one aspect of that knowledge

28
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
 if i hide this aspect it is not complete spiritual knowledge one aspect is hidden

29
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
 so for the sake of complete spiritual knowledge this has to be exposed

30
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
 whenever such a suffering was done i gave proof also

31
00:03:33 --> 00:03:39
 several proofs in my you can find that is to show the

32
00:03:40 --> 00:03:49
 personality of god the love of god see god has three aspects incarnation knowledge love

33
00:03:50 --> 00:04:00
 and miraculous powers three knowledge from god love god wisdom miraculous powers of god shiva

34
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
 these three are very fundamental essential things of a human incarnation of god

35
00:04:09 --> 00:04:10
 so

36
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
 this is only to to show that aspect god incarnation

37
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
 love of god is very important and it is very important to understand that god has the love for

38
00:04:26 --> 00:04:33
 devotees and really the love for devotees of god is very pure

39
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
 because the love of a human being for another human being is not true

40
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
 in

41
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
 it is told by sage

42
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
 the wife loves her husband

43
00:04:50 --> 00:04:57
 but for her happiness the husband loves the wife not for her happiness but for his happiness

44
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
 the father loves the son so that this fellow will serve me in the old age

45
00:05:04 --> 00:05:09
 but he is happy the son loves for his father he will give some property to me

46
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
 everywhere all these worldly bonds are selfish

47
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
 there is no

48
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
 sacrifice

49
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
 all are selfish all worldly bonds

50
00:05:22 --> 00:05:30
 except god because god has no need to derive happiness from you

51
00:05:30 --> 00:05:37
 all his desires were fulfilled he doesn't have any design

52
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
 then what is the need of anybody

53
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
 he doesn't have any desire

54
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
 he doesn't have any desire

55
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
 he doesn't have any desire

56
00:05:48 --> 00:05:49
 to get happiness from him

57
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
 so when god loves the devotee

58
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
 that love alone is without selfishness

59
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
 there is no selfishness

60
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
 if he loves

61
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
 he is not loving for his happiness

62
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
 he is loving for his happiness

63
00:06:07 --> 00:06:08
 devotee's happiness

64
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
 to uplift him

65
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
 so only god's love is without selfishness

66
00:06:15 --> 00:06:15
 and that is why we are not happy with our love for god

67
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
 all other world is not happy with our love for god

68
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
 all other world's love are selfish

69
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
 all other world's love are selfish

70
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
 all other world's love are selfish

71
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
 covered by illusion

72
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
 sweet honey capsule

73
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
 that's all

74
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
 but in the truth is

75
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
 every worldly bond is only selfish love

76
00:06:32 --> 00:06:33
 atmanas

77
00:06:33 --> 00:06:39
 only for selfish happiness

78
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
 these worldly bonds are loving you

79
00:06:43 --> 00:06:43
 that is truth

80
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
 that is truth

81
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
 that is truth

82
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
 if you are giving

83
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
 instead of giving happiness to the wife

84
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
 if you are giving torture

85
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
 she will run away

86
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
 no no no

87
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
 i will stay here only

88
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
 i want your happiness

89
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
 suppose by giving you torture to me

90
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
 you are happy

91
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
 my love is only for your happiness

92
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
 not for my happiness

93
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
 let me stay here itself

94
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
 will she stay

95
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
 she will not stay

96
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
 but she will not be

97
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
 so ways of love

98
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
 see that

99
00:07:24 --> 00:07:32
 if she had her

100
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
 if she had her

101
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
 family

102
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
 then

103
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
 but

104
00:07:44 --> 00:08:03
 When the life goes out and when your body gets decayed, giving smell, even the wife

105
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
 will not come near that.

106
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
 It is what he told Bhajagohindra.

107
00:08:08 --> 00:08:27
 But God comes to you, God comes to the dead body.

108
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
 So that is it.

109
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
 Swami, one more question Swami.

110
00:08:32 --> 00:08:38
 Shiva in his Tamasic state destroys.

111
00:08:38 --> 00:08:38
 So he destroys.

112
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
 He destroys both good and bad at the call of Mahapradaya.

113
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
 So what is destruction of good here Swami?

114
00:08:44 --> 00:08:53
 You see, good means suppose there is a good forest, good flower.

115
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
 Suppose there is some bad stone, he destroys both.

116
00:08:59 --> 00:09:06
 Oh this flower is good, let me destroy everything except this flower.

117
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
 He would feel like that.

118
00:09:08 --> 00:09:15
 Sarva, all world is destroyed without any discrimination between good and bad.

119
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
 This is bad mud, let me destroy this.

120
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
 This is very good flower, let me keep it.

121
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
 No, he will destroy both.

122
00:09:25 --> 00:09:32
 So for that discrimination, lack of discrimination, discrimination must not be there.

123
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
 When discrimination will be absent?

124
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
 When ignorance is there, discrimination will be absent.

125
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
 Ignorance is tabas.

126
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
 So he is made of tabas.

127
00:09:43 --> 00:09:51
 For that purpose, for that purpose, his quality is taken.

128
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
 What is Vishnu?

129
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
 He is ruling.

130
00:09:56 --> 00:10:04
 He must have knowledge, information of everything, every item, every aspect.

131
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
 A judge.

132
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
 He must have knowledge.

133
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
 He must have knowledge.

134
00:10:08 --> 00:10:16
 So for the sake of purpose, the quality is taken.

135
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
 And moreover, tamas has a very good side also.

136
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
 You see, I told every quality, if you turn it to good side, it is good quality.

137
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
 If you turn to bad side, that is bad quality.

138
00:10:29 --> 00:10:34
 Even good quality has bad face and even bad quality has good face.

139
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
 Anger, bad quality.

140
00:10:37 --> 00:10:45
 But when you show anger on a student who is indisciplined for his welfare, is that anger bad quality?

141
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
 It is a good quality there.

142
00:10:48 --> 00:10:55
 If you show anger on a good person, that is bad quality.

143
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
 Isn't it?

144
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
 So if you support, you see, helping anybody is good.

145
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
 If you support a bad fellow, is it a good quality?

146
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
 But helping is good quality.

147
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
 Paropakaara punyaya, papaya parapidana.

148
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
 Helping anybody is punya, good merit.

149
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
 And troubling anybody is sin.

150
00:11:18 --> 00:11:23
 If you trouble a bad fellow, is it sin?

151
00:11:23 --> 00:11:27
 Paritranaya sadhonam, vinasaya cha duskurdam, he told.

152
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
 What when, when you are a bad fellow, you are a good person.

153
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
 You are a good person.

154
00:11:30 --> 00:11:38
 What when, when Christian person asked me, you see, your Krishna told paritranaya sadhonam,

155
00:11:38 --> 00:11:47
 vinasaya cha duskurdam, but our Jesus told, love everybody, no question of punishment,

156
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
 see full love.

157
00:11:49 --> 00:11:58
 Then I asked him, then why in your Bible that liquid fire is mentioned?

158
00:11:58 --> 00:12:07
 Liquid fire, they say purugu chavadu, nippu aranam.

159
00:12:07 --> 00:12:16
 Purugu chavadu, this fellow will not die and the fire will not extinguish.

160
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
 Fire will not be stopped.

161
00:12:19 --> 00:12:25
 Continuous chitra himsa, full life long chitra himsa.

162
00:12:25 --> 00:12:26
 Is it love?

163
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
 Yes, it is love.

164
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
 It is also love, I told.

165
00:12:30 --> 00:12:38
 Because his aim is to change the quality of that soul and make him good.

166
00:12:38 --> 00:12:46
 Hell, I told in some, somewhere in the knowledge, hell is the best example for his love.

167
00:12:46 --> 00:12:56
 See, your own child got some fever, you want that fever should go quickly, you are taking

168
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
 him for, to the doctor for injection.

169
00:12:57 --> 00:13:04
 He cries, is it your vengeance, your anger on the child?

170
00:13:04 --> 00:13:12
 It is love on your child, if I give tablets it will take some more long time to

171
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
 cure the fever, now by this injection by evening he will come to normal.

172
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
 That is only your love, your extreme love is injection.

173
00:13:19 --> 00:13:25
 Your weak love is tablets.
