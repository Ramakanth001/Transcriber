is very secret, it is not a public topic because if I take somebody's sin, punishment andundergo the punishment, it is based on my love to that devotee.But how you can snatch that?Due to my love, I am undergoing the punishment.Is it justified for you to ask a share from it?Somebody has given me a poison due to love.I am eating, you are asking share from it?He has more love on me.You become more real devotee, you improve your devotion to become more and more realdevotee so that I can also take that poison from you also.Giving poison is your duty, eating poison is my duty.So moreover that is a very secret topic that is generally not opened.Rama, Krishna also, they also underwent those things but never that aspect was opened.Only that avataras, Shirdi Sai Baba and all these avataras, only that topic was opened.Otherwise it is a secret topic because if I undergo the punishment of the sin of my realdevotee and make him know that I have undergone the punishment of the devotee, punishmentof the devotee, it is not real love.Advertisement should not be in that.Secretly it should be an, then he will become grateful to me.That is again business devotion.Is it not?So it is without merit, top secret, it is highly secret.The devotee whom I love, I will take the pain, the punishment.All are not of that status.All are not real devotees also.Some people for their solutions of their worldly problems, they come to God, is not.So that is, that should not be exposed, that should not be advertised, that should notbe made public.Its sanctity will be lost.And this aspect is made public by me also several times only to, you see I took theresponsibility of propagating the true and complete spiritual knowledge.This also is one aspect of that knowledge.If I hide this aspect, it is not complete spiritual knowledge.One aspect is hidden.So for the sake of complete spiritual knowledge, this has to be exposed.Whenever such a suffering was done, I gave proof also.Several proofs in Mahayamuna you can find.That is to show the personality of God, the love of God.See God has three aspects, incarnation, knowledge, love and miraculous powers.Three, knowledge from God Brahma, love God Vishnu, miraculous powers of God Shiva.These three are very fundamental, essential things of a human in incarnation of God Gautama.So, this is only to show that aspect God incarnation has the love for devotees.And really the love for devotees of God is very pure.Because the love of a human being for another human being is not true.In Muthadharani Upanishad it is told by sage Agni Malkya, the wife loves her husband not for his happiness but for her happiness.The husband loves the wife not for her happiness but for his happiness.The father loves the son so that this fellow will serve me in the old age for his happiness.The son loves his father, he will give some property to me.Everywhere all these worldly bonds are selfish.There is no sacrifice.All are selfish, all worldly bonds.Except God.Because God has no need to derive happiness from you.Aptakamakse Kaspura, all his desires were fulfilled.He doesn't have any desire.What is the need of anybody to get happiness from him?So, when God loves the devotee, that love alone is without selfishness.There is no selfishness.Because God loves, he is not loving for his happiness.He is loving for his happiness, the devotee's happiness.So, only God's love is without selfishness.All other worldly loves are selfish, covered by illusion.Sweet honey capsule.But the inner truth is, every worldly bond is only selfish love.Atmanas sukamaya sarvam priyambhavati.Only for selfish happiness these worldly bonds are loving you.That is the truth.If you are giving, instead of giving happiness to the wife,if you are giving torture, she will come away.No, no, I will stay here only. I want your happiness.Suppose by giving torture to me, you are happy.My love is only for your happiness, not for my happiness.Let me stay here itself.Will she stay?She will not stay.Isn't that?So, God's love alone is pure, real, true.All other worldly loves are fraud, are false.As long as you are here, your people will cling to you.Gatavati vayu prana paye, bharia bhibhyati tasmin kaye.When the life goes out, and when your body gets decayed,giving smell, even the wife will not come near that.What he told Bhai Govinda?Gatavati vayu prana paye, bharia bhibhyati tasmin kaye.But God comes to you.God comes to you.Swami, one more question.Shiva in his tamasic state destroys both good and bad at the call of Mahapralaya.What is destruction of good here, Swami?You see, good means suppose there is a good forest, good flower.Suppose there is some bad stone.He destroys both.This flower is good.Let me destroy everything except this flower.He would say like that.Sarva, all, all world is destroyed without any discrimination between good and bad.This is bad mud.Let me destroy this.This is very good flower.Let me keep it.No, he will destroy both.So for that discrimination, lack of, discrimination must not be there.When discrimination will be absent?When ignorance is there, discrimination will be there.Ignorance is tamas.So he is made of tamas.For that purpose, for that purpose his quality is taken.What does he do?He is ruling.He must have knowledge.Information of everything, every item, every aspect, a judge.He must have knowledge.So for the sake of purpose, the quality is taken.And moreover, tamas has a very good side also.You see, I told every quality, if you turn it to good side, it is good quality.If you turn it to bad side, that is bad quality.Even good quality has bad face and even bad quality has good face.Anger, bad quality.But when you show anger on a student who is indisciplined for his welfare, is that anger bad quality?It is a good quality there.If you show anger on a good person, that is bad quality.Is it not?So if you support, you see, helping anybody is good.If you support a bad fellow, is it a good quality?But helping is good quality.Helping anybody is punya, good merit.And troubling anybody is sin.If you trouble a bad fellow, is it sin?Paritranaaya sadhunam vinashaya cha duskudram, he told.He told.What one Christian person asked me, you see, your Krishna told paritranaaya sadhunam vinashaya cha duskudram,but our Jesus told, love everybody, no question of punishment, see full love.Then I asked him, then why in your Bible that liquid fire is mentioned?Liquid fire, they say, purugu chavadu nippu aaradu.Purugu chavadu, this fellow will not die and the fire will not extinguish.Fire will not be stopped.Continuous chitra hamsa, full life long chitra hamsa.Is it love?Yes, it is love.It is also love, I told.Because his aim is to change the quality of that soul and make him good.I told somewhere in the knowledge, hell is the best example for his love.See, your own child got some fever.You want that fever should go quickly.You are taking him to the doctor for injection.He cries.Is it your vengeance, your anger on the child?It is love on your child.If I give tablets, it will take some more long time to cure the fever.Now by this injection, by evening he will come to normal.That is only your love.Your extreme love is injection.Your weak love is tablets.
