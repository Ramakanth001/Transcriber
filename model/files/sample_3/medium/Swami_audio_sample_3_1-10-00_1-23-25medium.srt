1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:11
 is very secret, it is not a public topic because if I take somebody's sin, punishment and

2
00:00:11 --> 00:00:21
 undergo the punishment, it is based on my love to that devotee.

3
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
 But how you can snatch that?

4
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
 Due to my love, I am undergoing the punishment.

5
00:00:31 --> 00:00:37
 Is it justified for you to ask a share from it?

6
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
 Somebody has given me a poison due to love.

7
00:00:41 --> 00:00:48
 I am eating, you are asking share from it?

8
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
 He has more love on me.

9
00:00:52 --> 00:00:57
 You become more real devotee, you improve your devotion to become more and more real

10
00:00:57 --> 00:01:05
 devotee so that I can also take that poison from you also.

11
00:01:05 --> 00:01:11
 Giving poison is your duty, eating poison is my duty.

12
00:01:11 --> 00:01:16
 So moreover that is a very secret topic that is generally not opened.

13
00:01:16 --> 00:01:22
 Rama, Krishna also, they also underwent those things but never that aspect was opened.

14
00:01:22 --> 00:01:29
 Only that avataras, Shirdi Sai Baba and all these avataras, only that topic was opened.

15
00:01:29 --> 00:01:37
 Otherwise it is a secret topic because if I undergo the punishment of the sin of my real

16
00:01:37 --> 00:01:44
 devotee and make him know that I have undergone the punishment of the devotee, punishment

17
00:01:45 --> 00:01:50
 of the devotee, it is not real love.

18
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
 Advertisement should not be in that.

19
00:01:53 --> 00:02:00
 Secretly it should be an, then he will become grateful to me.

20
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
 That is again business devotion.

21
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
 Is it not?

22
00:02:05 --> 00:02:12
 So it is without merit, top secret, it is highly secret.

23
00:02:12 --> 00:02:19
 The devotee whom I love, I will take the pain, the punishment.

24
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
 All are not of that status.

25
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
 All are not real devotees also.

26
00:02:26 --> 00:02:34
 Some people for their solutions of their worldly problems, they come to God, is not.

27
00:02:34 --> 00:02:41
 So that is, that should not be exposed, that should not be advertised, that should not

28
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
 be made public.

29
00:02:45 --> 00:02:50
 Its sanctity will be lost.

30
00:02:50 --> 00:02:57
 And this aspect is made public by me also several times only to, you see I took the

31
00:02:57 --> 00:03:04
 responsibility of propagating the true and complete spiritual knowledge.

32
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
 This also is one aspect of that knowledge.

33
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
 If I hide this aspect, it is not complete spiritual knowledge.

34
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
 One aspect is hidden.

35
00:03:21 --> 00:03:28
 So for the sake of complete spiritual knowledge, this has to be exposed.

36
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
 Whenever such a suffering was done, I gave proof also.

37
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
 Several proofs in Mahayamuna you can find.

38
00:03:37 --> 00:03:44
 That is to show the personality of God, the love of God.

39
00:03:44 --> 00:03:51
 See God has three aspects, incarnation, knowledge, love and miraculous powers.

40
00:03:52 --> 00:03:59
 Three, knowledge from God Brahma, love God Vishnu, miraculous powers of God Shiva.

41
00:04:02 --> 00:04:09
 These three are very fundamental, essential things of a human in incarnation of God Gautama.

42
00:04:09 --> 00:04:16
 So, this is only to show that aspect God incarnation has the love for devotees.

43
00:04:22 --> 00:04:29
 And really the love for devotees of God is very pure.

44
00:04:32 --> 00:04:39
 Because the love of a human being for another human being is not true.

45
00:04:40 --> 00:04:47
 In Muthadharani Upanishad it is told by sage Agni Malkya, the wife loves her husband not for his happiness but for her happiness.

46
00:04:51 --> 00:04:58
 The husband loves the wife not for her happiness but for his happiness.

47
00:04:58 --> 00:05:05
 The father loves the son so that this fellow will serve me in the old age for his happiness.

48
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
 The son loves his father, he will give some property to me.

49
00:05:10 --> 00:05:15
 Everywhere all these worldly bonds are selfish.

50
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
 There is no sacrifice.

51
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
 All are selfish, all worldly bonds.

52
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
 Except God.

53
00:05:28 --> 00:05:33
 Because God has no need to derive happiness from you.

54
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
 Aptakamakse Kaspura, all his desires were fulfilled.

55
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45
 He doesn't have any desire.

56
00:05:45 --> 00:05:50
 What is the need of anybody to get happiness from him?

57
00:05:50 --> 00:05:57
 So, when God loves the devotee, that love alone is without selfishness.

58
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
 There is no selfishness.

59
00:06:00 --> 00:06:05
 Because God loves, he is not loving for his happiness.

60
00:06:05 --> 00:06:10
 He is loving for his happiness, the devotee's happiness.

61
00:06:10 --> 00:06:15
 So, only God's love is without selfishness.

62
00:06:15 --> 00:06:22
 All other worldly loves are selfish, covered by illusion.

63
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
 Sweet honey capsule.

64
00:06:27 --> 00:06:32
 But the inner truth is, every worldly bond is only selfish love.

65
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
 Atmanas sukamaya sarvam priyambhavati.

66
00:06:36 --> 00:06:42
 Only for selfish happiness these worldly bonds are loving you.

67
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
 That is the truth.

68
00:06:46 --> 00:06:53
 If you are giving, instead of giving happiness to the wife,

69
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
 if you are giving torture, she will come away.

70
00:06:57 --> 00:07:01
 No, no, I will stay here only. I want your happiness.

71
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
 Suppose by giving torture to me, you are happy.

72
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
 My love is only for your happiness, not for my happiness.

73
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
 Let me stay here itself.

74
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
 Will she stay?

75
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
 She will not stay.

76
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
 Isn't that?

77
00:07:19 --> 00:07:27
 So, God's love alone is pure, real, true.

78
00:07:27 --> 00:07:34
 All other worldly loves are fraud, are false.

79
00:07:41 --> 00:07:46
 As long as you are here, your people will cling to you.

80
00:07:49 --> 00:07:54
 Gatavati vayu prana paye, bharia bhibhyati tasmin kaye.

81
00:07:54 --> 00:08:01
 When the life goes out, and when your body gets decayed,

82
00:08:01 --> 00:08:07
 giving smell, even the wife will not come near that.

83
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
 What he told Bhai Govinda?

84
00:08:09 --> 00:08:17
 Gatavati vayu prana paye, bharia bhibhyati tasmin kaye.

85
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
 But God comes to you.

86
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
 God comes to you.

87
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
 Swami, one more question.

88
00:08:32 --> 00:08:42
 Shiva in his tamasic state destroys both good and bad at the call of Mahapralaya.

89
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
 What is destruction of good here, Swami?

90
00:08:46 --> 00:08:53
 You see, good means suppose there is a good forest, good flower.

91
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
 Suppose there is some bad stone.

92
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
 He destroys both.

93
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
 This flower is good.

94
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
 Let me destroy everything except this flower.

95
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
 He would say like that.

96
00:09:09 --> 00:09:15
 Sarva, all, all world is destroyed without any discrimination between good and bad.

97
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
 This is bad mud.

98
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
 Let me destroy this.

99
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
 This is very good flower.

100
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
 Let me keep it.

101
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
 No, he will destroy both.

102
00:09:25 --> 00:09:32
 So for that discrimination, lack of, discrimination must not be there.

103
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
 When discrimination will be absent?

104
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
 When ignorance is there, discrimination will be there.

105
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
 Ignorance is tamas.

106
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
 So he is made of tamas.

107
00:09:45 --> 00:09:52
 For that purpose, for that purpose his quality is taken.

108
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
 What does he do?

109
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
 He is ruling.

110
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
 He must have knowledge.

111
00:09:59 --> 00:10:05
 Information of everything, every item, every aspect, a judge.

112
00:10:05 --> 00:10:09
 He must have knowledge.

113
00:10:09 --> 00:10:14
 So for the sake of purpose, the quality is taken.

114
00:10:14 --> 00:10:19
 And moreover, tamas has a very good side also.

115
00:10:19 --> 00:10:25
 You see, I told every quality, if you turn it to good side, it is good quality.

116
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
 If you turn it to bad side, that is bad quality.

117
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
 Even good quality has bad face and even bad quality has good face.

118
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
 Anger, bad quality.

119
00:10:36 --> 00:10:44
 But when you show anger on a student who is indisciplined for his welfare, is that anger bad quality?

120
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
 It is a good quality there.

121
00:10:47 --> 00:10:54
 If you show anger on a good person, that is bad quality.

122
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
 Is it not?

123
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
 So if you support, you see, helping anybody is good.

124
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
 If you support a bad fellow, is it a good quality?

125
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
 But helping is good quality.

126
00:11:07 --> 00:11:12
 Helping anybody is punya, good merit.

127
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
 And troubling anybody is sin.

128
00:11:17 --> 00:11:21
 If you trouble a bad fellow, is it sin?

129
00:11:21 --> 00:11:26
 Paritranaaya sadhunam vinashaya cha duskudram, he told.

130
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
 He told.

131
00:11:29 --> 00:11:40
 What one Christian person asked me, you see, your Krishna told paritranaaya sadhunam vinashaya cha duskudram,

132
00:11:40 --> 00:11:48
 but our Jesus told, love everybody, no question of punishment, see full love.

133
00:11:48 --> 00:11:55
 Then I asked him, then why in your Bible that liquid fire is mentioned?

134
00:11:55 --> 00:12:06
 Liquid fire, they say, purugu chavadu nippu aaradu.

135
00:12:06 --> 00:12:15
 Purugu chavadu, this fellow will not die and the fire will not extinguish.

136
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
 Fire will not be stopped.

137
00:12:18 --> 00:12:24
 Continuous chitra hamsa, full life long chitra hamsa.

138
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
 Is it love?

139
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
 Yes, it is love.

140
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
 It is also love, I told.

141
00:12:30 --> 00:12:39
 Because his aim is to change the quality of that soul and make him good.

142
00:12:39 --> 00:12:48
 I told somewhere in the knowledge, hell is the best example for his love.

143
00:12:48 --> 00:12:53
 See, your own child got some fever.

144
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
 You want that fever should go quickly.

145
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
 You are taking him to the doctor for injection.

146
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
 He cries.

147
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
 Is it your vengeance, your anger on the child?

148
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
 It is love on your child.

149
00:13:07 --> 00:13:12
 If I give tablets, it will take some more long time to cure the fever.

150
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
 Now by this injection, by evening he will come to normal.

151
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
 That is only your love.

152
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
 Your extreme love is injection.

153
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
 Your weak love is tablets.
