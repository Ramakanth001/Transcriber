he fought several wars previously while Rajasuya was done by Dharmaraja he went and fought all these four brothers went to four directions and he did wars why he withdraws from the war not because he is worried about violence he wants non-violence no no not like that because he has to kill his grandfather that is why he is making a cover no no no why I am necessarily killing all these he needs grandfather he will kill all except his grandfather once he starts fighting he has to kill him also this man so that is why when he fought with Bhishma for ten days he fought he did not really fought with Bhishma he did not really fight with Bhishma only putting arrows like that side arrows otherwise all very less days Nirvana five days Karna two days Shalya half day Jullayasana half day total 18 days only for Bhishma he took ten days only for Bhishma he took ten days because he is his grandfather from the childhood he nourished him he is almost like father because Pandu died even before he was born so therefore due to that Vyamaha that personal attraction personal relationship just like selecting somebody who is related in an interview the expert his relative is there a candidate then he will select the candidate he will argue he is best candidate whatever answer he has given that is present in the research whatever answer he has given that is present in the research not in the syllabus but latest papers have come on that but latest papers have come on that he is very advanced to it because he is related if he is outsider if he is not related to him he will say no he has given wrong answer he will say no he has given wrong answer so this partiality this partiality is there this partiality is there so that is why he in fact Arjuna came to fight for his life for his share it is actually Pruvruthi of course he is justified Pruvruthi not Dost Pruvruthi because he came for his righteous share unjust unjust thing he did not come righteous property he came share so he comes under Pruvruthi Pruvruthi means justice vote for justice against injustice vote for justice against injustice then Krishna told Krishna grasped this point that this fellow is leaving even that sacrificing that share for the sake of his grandfather for the sake of his bond with grandfather of his bond with grandfather that is the real secret and he is talking all nonsense just covering the fact Krishna also did not point out that actual fact hey fellow since your grandfather is there you are stopping from fighting that he did not tell in Bhagavad Gita because he kept it secret and he told everything else Krishna also since he did not tell it outside he did not tell that point anywhere in Gita what he told he came from another side I am God my work is to destroy injustice and establish justice Pandavas are on the side of justice Pundavas are on the side of justice you enter Pruvruthi then you are the servant of God you have you have cut all your worldly bonds all your worldly bonds are destroyed when he said all the worldly bonds are destroyed the bond with Bhishma Arsama Spiti indirectly he is telling that he knows that he has cut the point he indicated that but as Nivruthi as servant of God to help in establishing justice to help in condemning injustice you fought on my behalf as my servant he brought another strategy this fellow brought some other strategy to cover his point God also did not open that issue he also kept silent on that he brought another strategy I am God you are soul so God's work you must help God's program then only God will be pleased with you so like that he brought Nivruthi topic therefore you fight you fight as my servant to do to in my work you are participating as my servant this is not your work otherwise you don't want your share you don't want to fight ok I agree don't fight on that issue on that ground but fight on other ground I am God you are soul you must be servant to me this is my work and moreover even if you don't fight don't think that the war will stop they will be killed by me maya hatam sam jehe savya saachin I am going to kill them already the time has come I have decided to kill them you just stand only as an external outside fellow it is my work if you are not helping me I will do my work I will do my work I will do my work am I inefficient to do my work I can do my work and I can also help you in your work you can never do your work now what you can do how can you help my work ok so if you help my work then I will grace you you will be benefited if you don't help my work even then I will do my work I will do my work even then I will kill your grandfather maya hatam sam jehe savya saachin maya evete ne hata purvavete I have already killed them maya hatam sam jehe savya saachin maya evete ne hata purvavete I have already killed them these people who are standing against you they are only dead bodies they have no life I have already taken their life you are only killing the dead bodies that's all like that he is he went to Nivrutti and made him fight then he thought even if I withdraw my grandfather is going to die and by that I will lose also I will not get salvation is it not anyway he is going to die let me kill and get the salvation see anyway the thing is going to happen why not I get the benefit why should I lose so like that it was Krishna emphasized in Gita that you fight like my servant to help my program he fought never Krishna never asked I will help you I will kill all of them so at least in your share give me some share to me also he never asked in Gita he only asked you kill the injustice and establish justice that is my work you help my work since I am helping you give some share to me he never asked like that if we are there in the place of Krishna we will ask at least you fought you are fighting only for 50% of the share the other 50% give to me since I am helping you ok can we say Arjuna since Lord Krishna asked him to kill his grandfather can we say it was a test for Arjuna because he see test for Arjuna if you take test for Arjuna Arjuna failed a test see arjuna took two births afterwards as the hunter and swami he did not get salvation in that birth itself so even before testing arjuna showed his failure in that concept see when he is telling that i will not kill vishma will you kill vishma or not for my sake
