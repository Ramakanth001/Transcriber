1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
 he fought several wars

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
 previously while Rajasuya

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
 was done by Dharmaraja

4
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
 he went and

5
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
 fought

6
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
 all these four brothers went to four directions

7
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
 and he did wars

8
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
 why

9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
 he withdraws from the war

10
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
 not because

11
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
 he is

12
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
 worried about violence

13
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
 he wants non-violence

14
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
 no no not like that

15
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
 because he has to kill his grandfather

16
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
 that is why

17
00:00:33 --> 00:00:34
 he is making a cover

18
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
 no no no why I am necessarily killing all these

19
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
 he needs grandfather

20
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
 he will kill all except his grandfather

21
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
 once he starts fighting

22
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
 he has to kill him also

23
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
 this man

24
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
 so that is why when he fought with

25
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
 Bhishma for ten days

26
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
 he fought

27
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
 he did not really

28
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
 fought with Bhishma

29
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
 he did not really

30
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
 fight with Bhishma

31
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
 only putting arrows like that

32
00:01:03 --> 00:01:05
 side arrows

33
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
 otherwise all very less days

34
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
 Nirvana five days

35
00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
 Karna two days

36
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
 Shalya half day

37
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
 Jullayasana half day

38
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
 total 18 days

39
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
 only for Bhishma he took ten days

40
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
 only for Bhishma he took ten days

41
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
 because he is his grandfather

42
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
 from the childhood he nourished him

43
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
 he is almost like father

44
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
 because Pandu died even before he was born

45
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
 so therefore

46
00:01:31 --> 00:01:33
 due to that

47
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
 Vyamaha that

48
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
 personal

49
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
 attraction

50
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
 personal relationship

51
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
 just like selecting somebody who is related

52
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
 in an interview

53
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
 the expert his relative is there

54
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
 a candidate

55
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
 then he will select the candidate

56
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
 he will argue

57
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
 he is best candidate

58
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
 whatever answer he has given that is present in the research

59
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
 whatever answer he has given that is present in the research

60
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
 not in the syllabus

61
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
 but latest papers have come on that

62
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
 but latest papers have come on that

63
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
 he is very advanced to it

64
00:02:07 --> 00:02:09
 because he is related

65
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
 if he is outsider if he is not related to him

66
00:02:13 --> 00:02:15
 he will say no he has given wrong answer

67
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
 he will say no he has given wrong answer

68
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
 so this partiality

69
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
 this partiality is there

70
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
 this partiality is there

71
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
 so that is why

72
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
 he in fact

73
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
 Arjuna came to fight for his life

74
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
 for his share

75
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
 it is actually Pruvruthi

76
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
 of course he is

77
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
 justified Pruvruthi not

78
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
 Dost Pruvruthi because

79
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
 he came for his righteous share

80
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
 unjust

81
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
 unjust

82
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
 thing he did not come

83
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
 righteous property

84
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
 he came share

85
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
 so he comes under Pruvruthi

86
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
 Pruvruthi means justice

87
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
 vote for justice against injustice

88
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
 vote for justice against injustice

89
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
 then Krishna told Krishna

90
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
 grasped this point

91
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
 that this fellow is

92
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
 leaving even that

93
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
 sacrificing that share

94
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
 for the sake of his

95
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
 grandfather for the sake

96
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
 of his bond with grandfather

97
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
 of his bond with grandfather

98
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
 that is the real secret

99
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
 and he is

100
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
 talking all nonsense

101
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
 just covering the fact

102
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
 Krishna also

103
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
 did not point out

104
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
 that actual fact

105
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
 hey fellow

106
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
 since your grandfather is there

107
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
 you are stopping from fighting

108
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
 that he did not tell in Bhagavad Gita

109
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
 because he kept it secret

110
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
 and he told

111
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
 everything else

112
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
 Krishna also

113
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
 since he did not tell it outside

114
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
 he did not tell that point

115
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
 anywhere in Gita what he told

116
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
 he came from another side

117
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
 I am God

118
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
 my work is

119
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
 to destroy injustice

120
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
 and establish justice

121
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
 Pandavas are on the side of justice

122
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
 Pundavas are on the side of justice

123
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
 you enter

124
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
 Pruvruthi

125
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
 then you are the servant of God

126
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
 you have

127
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
 you have

128
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
 cut all your worldly bonds

129
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
 all your worldly bonds are destroyed

130
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
 when he said all the worldly bonds

131
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
 are destroyed the bond with Bhishma

132
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
 Arsama Spiti indirectly he is telling that

133
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
 he knows that he has

134
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
 cut the point

135
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
 he indicated that

136
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
 but as Nivruthi as servant of God

137
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
 to help

138
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
 in establishing justice

139
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
 to help in condemning injustice

140
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
 you fought on my behalf

141
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
 as my servant

142
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
 he brought another strategy

143
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
 this fellow brought

144
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
 some other strategy

145
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
 to cover his point

146
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
 God also

147
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
 did not

148
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
 open that issue

149
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
 he also kept silent

150
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
 on that he brought another strategy

151
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
 I am God

152
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
 you are soul

153
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
 so God's work

154
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
 you must help God's program

155
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
 then only God will be

156
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
 pleased with you

157
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
 so like that

158
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
 he brought Nivruthi topic

159
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
 therefore

160
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
 you fight

161
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
 you fight as my servant

162
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
 to do to

163
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
 in my work

164
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
 you are participating as my servant

165
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
 this is not your work

166
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
 otherwise you don't want your share

167
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
 you don't want to fight

168
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
 ok

169
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
 I agree

170
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
 don't fight on that issue

171
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
 on that ground

172
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
 but fight on other ground

173
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
 I am God

174
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
 you are soul

175
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
 you must be servant to me

176
00:05:55 --> 00:05:57
 this is my work

177
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
 and moreover

178
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
 even if you don't fight

179
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
 don't think that the war will stop

180
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
 they will be killed by me

181
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
 maya hatam sam jehe savya saachin

182
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
 I am going to kill them

183
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
 already the time has come

184
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
 I have decided to kill them

185
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
 you just stand only as an external outside fellow

186
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
 it is my work

187
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
 if you are not helping me

188
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
 I will do my work

189
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
 I will do my work

190
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
 I will do my work

191
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
 am I inefficient to do my work

192
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
 I can do my work

193
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
 and I can also help you in your work

194
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
 you can never do your work

195
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
 now

196
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
 what you can do

197
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
 how can you help my work

198
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
 ok

199
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
 so if you help my work

200
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
 then

201
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
 I will grace you

202
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
 you will be benefited

203
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
 if you don't help my work

204
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
 even then I will do my work

205
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
 I will do my work

206
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
 even then I will kill your grandfather

207
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
 maya hatam sam jehe savya saachin

208
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
 maya evete ne hata purvavete

209
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
 I have already killed them

210
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
 maya hatam sam jehe savya saachin

211
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
 maya evete ne hata purvavete

212
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
 I have already killed them

213
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
 these people who are standing against you

214
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
 they are only dead bodies

215
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
 they have no life

216
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
 I have already taken their life

217
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
 you are only killing the dead bodies

218
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
 that's all

219
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
 like that he is

220
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
 he went to Nivrutti

221
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
 and made him fight

222
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
 then he thought

223
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
 even if I withdraw

224
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
 my grandfather is going to die

225
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
 and by that I will lose also

226
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
 I will not get salvation

227
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
 is it not

228
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
 anyway he is going to die

229
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
 let me kill and get the salvation

230
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
 see

231
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
 anyway the thing is going to happen

232
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
 why not I get the benefit

233
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
 why should I lose

234
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
 so like that

235
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
 it was Krishna

236
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
 emphasized in Gita

237
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
 that you fight

238
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
 like my servant

239
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
 to help my program

240
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
 he fought

241
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
 never Krishna never asked

242
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
 I will help you

243
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
 I will kill all of them

244
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
 so at least in your share

245
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
 give me some share to me also

246
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
 he never asked in Gita

247
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
 he only asked

248
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
 you kill the injustice

249
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
 and establish justice

250
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
 that is my work

251
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
 you help my work

252
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
 since I am helping you

253
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
 give some share to me

254
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
 he never asked like that

255
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
 if we are there in the place of Krishna

256
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
 we will ask

257
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
 at least you fought

258
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
 you are fighting only for 50% of the share

259
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
 the other 50%

260
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
 give to me

261
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
 since I am helping you

262
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
 ok

263
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
 can we say Arjuna

264
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
 since Lord Krishna asked him to kill his grandfather

265
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
 can we say

266
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
 it was a test for Arjuna

267
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
 because he

268
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
 see

269
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
 test for Arjuna

270
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
 if you take

271
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
 test for Arjuna

272
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
 Arjuna failed

273
00:09:25 --> 00:09:34
 a test see arjuna took two births afterwards as the hunter and swami

274
00:09:36 --> 00:09:40
 he did not get salvation in that birth itself so

275
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
 even before testing

276
00:09:47 --> 00:09:54
 arjuna showed his failure in that concept see when he is telling that i will not kill

277
00:09:55 --> 00:10:00
 vishma will you kill vishma or not for my sake
