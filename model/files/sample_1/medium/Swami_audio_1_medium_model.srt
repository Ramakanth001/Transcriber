1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
 He fought several wars previously.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
 While Rajasuya Yaga was done, Ijna was done by Dharmaraja.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
 He went and fought.

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
 All these four brothers went into four directions and he did wars.

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
 Why he withdraws from the war?

6
00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
 Not because he is worried about violence.

7
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
 He wants non-violence or himsa.

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
 No, no, not like that.

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
 Because he has to kill his grandfather, that is why he is making a cover.

10
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
 No, no, no, why you are necessarily killing all these?

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:39
 He needs grandfather.

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
 He will kill all except his grandfather.

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
 Once he starts fighting, he has to kill him also.

14
00:00:49 --> 00:00:55
 So that is why when he fought with Bheeshma, for ten days he fought.

15
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
 He did not really fought with Bheeshma.

16
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
 Only putting arrows like that, side arrows.

17
00:01:05 --> 00:01:15
 All very less days, Nirvana five days, Karna two days, Shailya half day, Duryodhana half day.

18
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
 Total eighteen days.

19
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
 Only for Bheeshma he took ten days.

20
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
 Because he is his grandfather.

21
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
 From the childhood he nourished him.

22
00:01:25 --> 00:01:29
 He is almost like father because Ponto died even before him.

23
00:01:31 --> 00:01:41
 So therefore, due to that yamaha, that personal attraction, personal relationship, just like

24
00:01:41 --> 00:01:49
 selecting somebody who is related in an interview, the expert, his relative is there, a candidate,

25
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
 then he will select the candidate.

26
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
 He will argue.

27
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
 He is the best candidate.

28
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
 Whatever answer he has given, that is present in the research.

29
00:01:58 --> 00:02:04
 Not in the syllabus, but latest papers have come on that.

30
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
 He is very advanced to it like that.

31
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
 Because he is related.

32
00:02:10 --> 00:02:16
 If he is outsider, if he is not related to him, he will say no, he has given wrong answer.

33
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
 So this partiality, this partiality is there.

34
00:02:23 --> 00:02:31
 So that is why he, in fact, Arjuna came to fight for his share.

35
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
 It is actually pruruti.

36
00:02:33 --> 00:02:41
 Of course, he is justified pruruti, not dush pruruti because he came for his right way

37
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
 share.

38
00:02:42 --> 00:02:48
 For unjust thing he did not come.

39
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
 Right way prapati he came, share.

40
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
 So, he comes under pruruti.

41
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
 Pruruti means justice, vote for justice against injustice.

42
00:02:58 --> 00:03:08
 Then Krishna told, Krishna grasped this point that this fellow is leaving even that, sacrificing

43
00:03:08 --> 00:03:16
 letter share for the sake of his grandfather, for the sake of his bond with grandfather.

44
00:03:16 --> 00:03:21
 That is the real secret.

45
00:03:21 --> 00:03:26
 And he is talking all nonsense, just covering the fact.

46
00:03:26 --> 00:03:32
 Krishna also did not point out that actual fact.

47
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
 I said, no, since your grandfather is there, you are stopping from fighting.

48
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
 That he did not tell in Bhagavad Gita.

49
00:03:40 --> 00:03:45
 Because he kept it secret and told everything else.

50
00:03:45 --> 00:03:52
 Krishna also, since he did not tell it outside, he did not tell that point anywhere in Gita.

51
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
 What he told, he came from another side.

52
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
 I am God.

53
00:03:58 --> 00:04:03
 My work is to destroy injustice and establish justice.

54
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
 Pandavas are on the side of justice.

55
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
 Kauravas are on the side of justice.

56
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
 You enter nivruthi.

57
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
 Then you are the servant of God.

58
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
 You have cut all your worldly bonds.

59
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
 All your worldly bonds are destroyed.

60
00:04:21 --> 00:04:26
 When he said all the worldly bonds are destroyed, the bond with Bhishma also must be destroyed.

61
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
 He is telling that.

62
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
 He knows that he has cut the point.

63
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
 He indicated that.

64
00:04:32 --> 00:04:41
 But as a nivruthi, as a servant of God, to help in establishing justice, to help in condemning

65
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
 injustice, you fought on my behalf as my servant.

66
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
 He brought another strategy.

67
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
 This fellow brought some other strategy to cover his point.

68
00:04:54 --> 00:04:59
 God also did not open that issue.

69
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
 He also kept silent on that.

70
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
 He brought another strategy.

71
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
 I am God.

72
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
 You are soul.

73
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
 So, God's work, you must help God's program.

74
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
 Then only God will be pleased with you.

75
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
 So, like that, he brought nivruthi topic.

76
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
 Therefore, you fight.

77
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
 You fight as my servant.

78
00:05:28 --> 00:05:33
 In my work, you are participating as my servant.

79
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
 It is not your work.

80
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
 Only you don't want your share.

81
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
 You don't want to fight.

82
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
 Okay.

83
00:05:40 --> 00:05:41
 I agree.

84
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
 Don't fight on that issue, on that ground.

85
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
 But fight on other ground.

86
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
 I am God.

87
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
 You are soul.

88
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
 You must be servant to me.

89
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
 This is my work.

90
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
 This is not your work.

91
00:05:56 --> 00:06:02
 And moreover, even if you don't fight, don't think that the war will stop.

92
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
 They will be killed by me.

93
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
 Maya hatam sumje he savye sachin.

94
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
 I am going to kill them.

95
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
 Already the time has come.

96
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
 I have decided to kill them.

97
00:06:14 --> 00:06:19
 You just stand only as an external outside fellow.

98
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
 It is my work.

99
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
 If you are not helping me, I will do my work.

100
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
 Am I inefficient to do my work?

101
00:06:29 --> 00:06:34
 I can do my work and I can also help you in your work.

102
00:06:34 --> 00:06:39
 You can neither do your work nor I.

103
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
 How can you help my work?

104
00:06:42 --> 00:06:43
 Okay.

105
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
 Excellent.

106
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
 So, if you help my work, then I will grace you.

107
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
 You will be benefited.

108
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
 If you don't help my work, even then I will do my work.

109
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
 Even then I am going to kill your grandfather.

110
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
 Maya hatam sumje he savye sachin.

111
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
 I have already killed them.

112
00:07:07 --> 00:07:14
 These people who are standing against you, they are only dead bodies.

113
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
 They have no life.

114
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
 I have already taken their life.

115
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
 You are only killing the dead bodies.

116
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
 That's all.

117
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
 Like that he went to Nivruthi and made him fight.

118
00:07:30 --> 00:07:37
 Then he thought, even if I withdraw, my grandfather is going to die.

119
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
 And by that I will lose also.

120
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
 I will not get salvation.

121
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
 Anyway he is going to die.

122
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
 Let me kill and get salvation.

123
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
 See, anything is going to happen.

124
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
 Why not I get the benefit?

125
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
 Why should I lose?

126
00:07:56 --> 00:08:09
 So, like that it was Krishna emphasized in Gita that you fight like my servant to help my program.

127
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
 He fought.

128
00:08:12 --> 00:08:17
 Krishna never asked, I will help you.

129
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
 I will kill all of them.

130
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
 So at least in your share, give me some share to me also.

131
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
 He never asked in Gita.

132
00:08:25 --> 00:08:30
 He only asked you to kill the injustice and establish justice.

133
00:08:30 --> 00:08:31
 That is my work.

134
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
 You help my work.

135
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
 Since I am helping you, give some share to me.

136
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
 He never asked like that.

137
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
 If we are there in the place of Krishna, we will ask him.

138
00:08:44 --> 00:08:49
 At least you fought, you are fighting only for 50% of the share.

139
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
 The other 50% give to me.

140
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
 Since I am helping you.

141
00:08:55 --> 00:09:14
 He said that Arjuna, since Lord Krishna asked him to kill his grandfather, can we say it was a test for Arjuna?

142
00:09:14 --> 00:09:25
 See, test for Arjuna, if you take a test for Arjuna, Arjuna failed in that test.

143
00:09:25 --> 00:09:34
 See Arjuna took two births afterwards as the hunter and Swami Vivekananda.

144
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
 He did not get salvation in that birth itself.

145
00:09:38 --> 00:09:51
 So, even before testing, Arjuna showed he will fail you in that concept.

146
00:09:51 --> 00:09:59
 See when he is telling that I will not kill Bhishma, will you kill Bhishma or not for my sake?
