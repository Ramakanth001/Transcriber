1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:10
 Worship can be done in presence of God or away from God also.

2
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
 See what is meditation?

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
 What is doing prayers?

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:23
 We are doing prayers to God, He is not before our eyes, but still you are praying God.

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
 That is worship.

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
 God is worship.

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:33
 And Sangatkarana, that is association.

8
00:00:33 --> 00:00:39
 Then next is association, physical association, that is in presence of God.

9
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
 That is Sangatkarana, Dhaneshw.

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
 Then by doing sacrifice, a Jnana is sacrifice.

11
00:00:48 --> 00:00:57
 In the name of Karma Sanyasa, service, sacrifice is the fruit of your work.

12
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
 That is Karma Parachyaka.

13
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
 Both these constitute Karma Yoga.

14
00:01:02 --> 00:01:11
 So this worship, you need not...

15
00:01:11 --> 00:01:18
 See actually the physical presence of God is very much essential to clarify the doubts.

16
00:01:18 --> 00:01:25
 Clearing the doubts is the main purpose of the physical presence of God.

17
00:01:25 --> 00:01:32
 In those days there were no these systems, online systems, no phone, nothing like that.

18
00:01:32 --> 00:01:38
 If you want to talk with God Krishna, you have to go to Dwaraka and talk with Him.

19
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
 There was no phone.

20
00:01:40 --> 00:01:47
 So therefore you cannot clear your doubts from God directly if you are not physically

21
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
 near to God.

22
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
 But now it is not there.

23
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
 Now online system is there, so many phones are there or there.

24
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
 So you can clear your doubts through the online system.

25
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
 This is worship.

26
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
 Actually Krishna told that he likes only the Jnana, the spiritual knowledge.

27
00:02:06 --> 00:02:15
 So when you clarify your doubts and when the answers are given, the Jnana is done.

28
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
 Now there is no need of away and far.

29
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
 You know the screen also has come.

30
00:02:20 --> 00:02:25
 Through screen you can see, you can talk.

31
00:02:25 --> 00:02:31
 That olden day inconvenience is not there today.

32
00:02:32 --> 00:02:37
 That problem will not come, far and near.

33
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
 That problem will not come.

34
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
 Okay?

35
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
 Okay Mr. Surya?

36
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
 Surya asked this question.

37
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
 Hello Swami.

38
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
 Okay, is it alright?

39
00:02:44 --> 00:02:57
 Swami, only the aspect of that enjamb is taking or the offering of the Jnana, the Jnana is

40
00:02:57 --> 00:03:12
 not only offering, offering food, offering cloths, offering Guru Darshanas, all these

41
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
 come under Yajna.

42
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
 And also Deva Puja, that is Deva Puja, that is doing worship.

43
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
 Worship by prayers, worship by meditation.

44
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
 Previously you have to keep a statue of Krishna.

45
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
 Suppose you are away from Dvaraka, you have to keep a statue of Krishna.

46
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
 Statues were there in the olden days.

47
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
 Then you have to worship.

48
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
 Now it is not necessary, you can see directly on the screen.

49
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
 Sangatkarana, association.

50
00:03:47 --> 00:03:52
 You can either, if you are very near to him, you can have physical association.

51
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
 Sangatkarana.

52
00:03:54 --> 00:04:04
 Online, when online you are seeing and talking with the sagguru, you have the same effect.

53
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
 As if you are near, you are sitting near to him.

54
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
 You are directly asking, you are directly, see when God comes as incarnation, there are

55
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
 four fortunes.

56
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
 That is Darshanas, Parishanas, Sambhasanas, Sahavasas.

57
00:04:22 --> 00:04:30
 So this Darshanas you can have by the electronic media equipment.

58
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
 Parishana of course is not necessary as Parishana, means doing Sastana Namaskaram.

59
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
 Even you are doing Namaskaram, you are touching his feet.

60
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
 That is Parishana.

61
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
 So Darshanas, Parishanas, Sambhasana, you are doing that through electronic instrument.

62
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
 Only Sahavasas.

63
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
 Sahavasas is not aspired by all.

64
00:04:51 --> 00:04:58
 Only few, since he was in Burundavanam, Sahavasas was gained by Gopikas.

65
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
 They were also staying there.

66
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
 They were staying in the same city.

67
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
 So they can have Sahavasas.

68
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
 They can stay together.

69
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
 They are frequently visiting.

70
00:05:12 --> 00:05:19
 So almost all those four fortunes are accomplished today.

71
00:05:19 --> 00:05:26
 Even if one is far from the Sadguru or the human incarnation of God.

72
00:05:26 --> 00:05:32
 Please make a note that I am not telling that I am the human incarnation of God.

73
00:05:32 --> 00:05:39
 I am telling only about the concept of a devotee and human incarnation of God.

74
00:05:39 --> 00:05:47
 Human incarnation of God like Rama, Krishna, Adi Shankara, Ramamjaya, Narasimha Saraswati, Sri Pada Vallabha.

75
00:05:47 --> 00:05:54
 So I am speaking about the Sadguru and the devotee only.

76
00:05:54 --> 00:06:07
 Otherwise Satyarendi will ask, Swami, you suppressed Bali, Triviyatri, you came as Vamana and suppressed him.

77
00:06:07 --> 00:06:14
 Then I told the Kerala government, you see in Kerala Bali has very good following.

78
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
 They like him very much in Kerala.

79
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
 They worship Bali.

80
00:06:19 --> 00:06:29
 So if you say that, if they come to know that I have pressed Bali, they will give a police report and they will proceed here to arrest me.

81
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
 So don't tell like that.

82
00:06:37 --> 00:06:43
 I am telling only the concepts.

83
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
 To apply to me or not that is a personal issue.

84
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
 It should not be in several people.

85
00:06:51 --> 00:06:57
 That personal aspect comes only some people.

86
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
 It differs.

87
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
 It is up to their choice.

88
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
 It is optional.

89
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
 But the concepts are mandatory.

90
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
 General concepts.

91
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
 Yes.

92
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
 Swami, I have a question.

93
00:07:11 --> 00:07:19
 Swami, in Bhagavad Gita it is told that swadharma, nidramasriya, paradharma, bhaya bhava.

94
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
 How can we distinguish between swadharma and paradharma?

95
00:07:23 --> 00:07:28
 See here swadharma, dharma can be taken.

96
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34
 They say our religion Hinduism, people nowadays speak it is sanatana dharma.

97
00:07:34 --> 00:07:37
 They don't say it is matam.

98
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
 It is not a matam.

99
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
 It is not a religion.

100
00:07:40 --> 00:07:44
 It is only dharma, way of living.

101
00:07:44 --> 00:07:52
 So they have placed this word dharma as an alternative for the religion.

102
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
 Hinduism instead of Hindu matam, they call it as sanatana dharma.

103
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
 So when Krishna told swadharma, nidramasriya, means if you are born as Hindu,

104
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
 be as a Hindu and die nidramasriya, die as a Hindu.

105
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
 There is no need of changing the religion.

106
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
 You did not become a Christian, you did not become Muslim.

107
00:08:14 --> 00:08:20
 Because all these religions are leading to same God.

108
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
 So different religions were created and God came to different religions in different forms.

109
00:08:26 --> 00:08:33
 The same God came in different forms and preached the same syllabus.

110
00:08:33 --> 00:08:39
 You see any religion the main syllabus contains three main items.

111
00:08:39 --> 00:08:45
 One is God, another is heaven, another is hell.

112
00:08:45 --> 00:08:49
 God for spiritual side, for personal worship, to get the grace of God.

113
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
 That is for nivrutti.

114
00:08:51 --> 00:08:58
 And for pravrutti where dharma, justice is to be protected and injustice to be condemned,

115
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
 for that swaga and naraka, heaven and hell are.

116
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
 Heaven and hell constitute pravrutti.

117
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
 God constitutes nivrutti. Of course God is also present in pravrutti.

118
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
 He is the support of everything, whole thing.

119
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
 But especially He is very much concentrated in nivrutti.

120
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
 That is why I am telling God for nivrutti.

121
00:09:18 --> 00:09:29
 So this heaven, hell, God, these three aspects are present in every religion except atheism.

122
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
 In atheism they don't believe in God.

123
00:09:33 --> 00:09:43
 So when they believe in good deed and bad deed, they also don't believe in heaven and hell.

124
00:09:43 --> 00:09:51
 So there atheists say that we will follow ethics, we will not do any injustice.

125
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
 For that there is no need of God, there is no need of force.

126
00:09:55 --> 00:10:00
 I think he is a big angel, no need of...

127
00:10:00 --> 00:10:08
 Without fear from God, he controls himself and he will not do any injustice.

128
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
 There is no fear of injustice because there is no hell.

129
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
 So why he will not do injustice?

130
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
 It is only public speech.

131
00:10:18 --> 00:10:25
 He is deceiving the public so that the public will have good impression about him.

132
00:10:25 --> 00:10:34
 So that even if he doesn't sin secretly, if it comes out, then public will not so much respond, react.

133
00:10:34 --> 00:10:40
 To escape the public reaction, he is telling I will do justice only.

134
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
 I will not entertain injustice.

135
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
 It is hypocrisy.

136
00:10:45 --> 00:10:49
 If you are not doing injustice and if you are doing justice only,

137
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
 what is the harm in accepting the existence of heaven and hell?

138
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
 You are a very liberal, very evolved person.

139
00:10:59 --> 00:11:03
 So without heaven and hell you are doing justice and not doing injustice.

140
00:11:03 --> 00:11:08
 But what about other people who are below your standard?

141
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
 They need some threats, some fear.

142
00:11:10 --> 00:11:16
 So heaven and hell, God, let fear, let it be there for ordinary people.

143
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
 For you it may not be necessary.

144
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
 So it is all hypocrisy.

145
00:11:20 --> 00:11:29
 They do injustice secretly and if it comes out, then courts, police and etc. will come.

146
00:11:29 --> 00:11:35
 So therefore they will do injustice secretly fearing for the government,

147
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
 for the law, for the law of the country.

148
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
 They fear only that.

149
00:11:40 --> 00:11:46
 And therefore swadharma, swadharma means your religion.

150
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
 It can be told as your religion because every religion contains these three things only.

151
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
 So swadharma means your religion.

152
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
 There is no need of changing your religion.

153
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
 You are born as a Hindu, you are born in Hindu religion.

154
00:12:01 --> 00:12:06
 If you die as a Hindu, don't change into other religion because there is no need.

155
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
 It is a waste of time.

156
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
 Because everywhere the same God is present in different forms.

157
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
 Everywhere heaven is there.

158
00:12:14 --> 00:12:18
 If you do good deeds, rewards are given through heaven.

159
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
 If you do bad deeds, punishments are given through hell.

160
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
 So everything is same.

161
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
 Set up is same.

162
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
 Infrastructure is same in every religion.

163
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
 So there is no need of changing your religion.

164
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
 Of course there may be some defects and some merits.

165
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
 Some defects are present in every religion.

166
00:12:39 --> 00:12:44
 Some type of defects may be in Hinduism, some other types of defects may be in other religion.

167
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
 Or sometimes same defects also may be present there.

168
00:12:48 --> 00:12:54
 So avoid the defects of religion by your sharp analysis.

169
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
 In any religion you will face merits and defects.

170
00:12:57 --> 00:13:03
 Defects are introduced in the religion through bad followers of that religion.

171
00:13:03 --> 00:13:12
 And merits are introduced into a religion by the establishment of that religion and good followers of that religion.

172
00:13:12 --> 00:13:17
 Everywhere, in every religion both merits and defects are there.

173
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
 You have to filter the defects and follow the merits.

174
00:13:21 --> 00:13:29
 And if you filter all the defects of every religion, the residue left over is only merits.

175
00:13:29 --> 00:13:35
 And you will find complete unity in all religions.

176
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
 If defects are removed, merit is one and the same.

177
00:13:39 --> 00:13:45
 There is God, fear for God, don't do sin, always do justice.

178
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
 Then you will go to heaven.

179
00:13:47 --> 00:13:52
 If you personally worship God, you will go to the abode of God.

180
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
 That is new thing.

181
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
 These are present everywhere, in every religion.

182
00:13:58 --> 00:14:02
 So therefore there the shloka means,

183
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
 swatharme nidharam nidharam sreyaha.

184
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
 If you are born in a religion, you die in that same religion.

185
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
 There is no need of changing the religion.

186
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
 Paradhamo bhaya vaha.

187
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
 If you change the religion, it gives you fear.

188
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
 Because you cannot adjust.

189
00:14:19 --> 00:14:26
 See, when you are born in particular religion from the beginning, you can easily adjust in that religion.

190
00:14:26 --> 00:14:31
 When you change to other religion, you cannot easily naturally adjust.

191
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
 Adjustment is very difficult.

192
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
 Just like when the daughter-in-law goes to father-in-law's house,

193
00:14:39 --> 00:14:40
 she has to adjust.

194
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
 Some inconvenience will be there in the beginning.

195
00:14:43 --> 00:14:49
 Of course for some days they will treat you well, but afterwards they show their color.

196
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
 Then there will be some inconvenience.

197
00:14:53 --> 00:14:59
 So therefore, bhaya vaha means there will be some inconvenience.

198
00:14:59 --> 00:15:04
 Since you are born in this religion, you can naturally adjust.

199
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
 Adjustment is very natural.

200
00:15:07 --> 00:15:13
 So if you are born in a religion, die in that religion, don't change into other religion.

201
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
 That is the meaning of that verse.
