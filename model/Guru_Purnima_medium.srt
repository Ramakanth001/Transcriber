1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Swami, shall we start, Swami?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 So then, shall we start, Swami?

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Today we are celebrating Guru Purnima.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Say, Guru is nothing but to remove our ignorance.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Say, Lord Datta, he is the Guru Datta.

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 He always comes, incarnate himself to remove our ignorance.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And our beloved Sri Ratta Swami is incarnation of Lord Datta and came down in human form to give excellent knowledge and remove our ignorance and showing in, taking us in a right direction and a right path.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And we know in spirituality we have lot of questions and lot of priesthood knowledge was also there.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And Swami is correlated all the spiritual knowledge.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Like today we have said Guru Purnima is Vyarava Vedavyasa birthday.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Our Swami is correlated even all the Vedas, Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, Prasthana Trin, not only that He correlated even the modern science up to this point.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Swami is giving excellent spiritual knowledge.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Only He incarnate to remove our ignorance.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Datta Swami is none other than the Lord Datta himself.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And we are so fortunate that today directly we are meeting, we are talking and we are seeing our contemporary human incarnation.

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 It's so fortune that we can directly get all clarifications, all our doubts.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 He will clear all our doubts.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 If everybody can ask whatever they got doubts, Swami will clear all our doubts.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I pray Swami please remove our ignorance and give your blessings to all of us.

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 So anybody have questions can ask, can question Swami, Swami can answer all the questions.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Shall I ask? Yes, yes.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Aday Namaskaram Swami, this is Bharat Krishna.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Swami my question is generally it is said that it will take millions of janmas to achieve the spiritual goal which is to please God, that is the human incarnation of God.

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Why it takes so much time Swami?

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 See in Bhagavad Gita there is one verse,

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Adhajeenam nishchayatam nishcham vamanyaseyamrutam

27
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 That means, if you are not in the spiritual world,

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 In Bhagavad Gita there is one verse,

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Adhajeenam nishchayatam nishcham vamanyaseyamrutam

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 That means, this soul, this individual soul dies in the night in deep sleep.

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And in the morning when he wakes, he is reborn.

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 So one day in one life.

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So many dasas, many days, not years, not lives, not even years.

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Just one day morning he is born, night he dies in deep sleep.

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Therefore, if you take the right interpretation,

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 It means only after many days only you can get the salvation. That's all.

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So here, the question is, why it takes so much time?

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 The verse in Bhagavad Gita says,

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 This soul dies in deep sleep every day.

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And in the morning when he wakes, he is reborn.

41
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 So one day in one life.

42
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 So many dasas means many days.

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 So there is nothing to worry about.

44
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Thank you Swami. Excellent.

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Swamiji, I have one question Swamiji.

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 With respect to having expectation of the fruit of a work that has been performed,

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 should not be there to avoid tension.

48
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 But how can a work be done without having an intention of doing it for a particular fruit?

49
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 That I am not able to understand.

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So you see, you can have intention for some fruit.

51
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 You are working for it. To achieve the fruit, you are doing work.

52
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 That much initial intention is alright.

53
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 But during the entire course of work, if you always think about the fruit only,

54
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 then your energy will be exhausted in thinking about the fruit and energy is limited always.

55
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And that limited energy is spent in thinking about the fruit, in the excitation only.

56
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Then there will be no energy to do the work.

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Then you will not get the fruit.

58
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Initially you can have some fixation of fruit.

59
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Later on you should not think about the fruit.

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 If you go on thinking due to attraction towards fruit,

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 if you go on thinking and worrying about the fruit,

62
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 all your energy will be spent in that worry, in that excitation,

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 in thinking about the fruit only, then energy will be over.

64
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Energy is limited.

65
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Then energy is not remaining to do the work.

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 You will stop doing work in the middle itself.

67
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And if the work is not completed, you will not get the fruit.

68
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Therefore you should not worry about the fruit.

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Once you start the work, you should not worry about the fruit.

70
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 He is asking,

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 the person who thinks about the fruit should keep working.

72
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 How can he do the work if he thinks about the fruit?

73
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 The first thing he should do is to decide that he is doing this work for the fruit.

74
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But if he thinks only about the fruit while working,

75
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 he will not get the fruit.

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 If he thinks only about the fruit, he will get excited.

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 With this, he will spend his energy.

78
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Then energy will not remain.

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 You will not be able to do the work in the middle.

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 If you do not do the work, you will not get the fruit.

81
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 If you work completely, you will not get the fruit.

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Therefore, if you think only about the fruit,

83
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 you will not be able to do the work while thinking about the excitation.

84
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Thank you, Swamiji.

85
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Okay.

86
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Swamiji, hello.

87
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Dhanamaskaram, Swamiji.

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Namaste.

89
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Can I ask a question?

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Yes.

91
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Swamiji, without any mistake, someone cheated on us.

92
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So how do we take care of that person without any mistakes that people cheat on us?

93
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Then how do we think about it in that way?

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Is it our karma that that person has to teach us some lessons in our life?

95
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 You see, if you want to escape cheating, you should have precaution.

96
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Prevention is better than cure.

97
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Okay, already somebody cheated and you underwent some loss.

98
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Now, the next necessary thing is to take care in the future.

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Take it as a lesson.

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 First, if you go to the background, it is only due to past karma.

101
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 You might have cheated that fellow in the past birth, and now he is cheating you.

102
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So that is a retarded case, the mutual canceling.

103
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So you cannot take action against him.

104
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 If it is a retarded case, you cannot do anything against that.

105
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 If it is a fresh case, you have not cheated him in the previous birth.

106
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Freshly he has cheated you now in this birth.

107
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 In that case, you live to God and don't have any revenge attitude, vengeance.

108
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Don't show vengeance.

109
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Keep silent and live to God and pray God.

110
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 If it is a fresh case, God will certainly punish him, not only punish him.

111
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 See, if he is punished, your loss will not be compensated.

112
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 So you should not think about his punishment.

113
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Punishing him, punishment means to reform him.

114
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 By punishment, God is going to reform that sinner.

115
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It is only for reformation, not for vengeance, not for revenge.

116
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Even if he is punished, how your vengeance goes?

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Because your loss is a loss, your loss is not compensated.

118
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 What do you get by punishing him?

119
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Nothing you will get. Your loss is there.

120
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So when you are thinking with revenge, vengeance attitude, your health is spoiled.

121
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Previous loss plus more loss.

122
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 So therefore, don't develop any revenge attitude.

123
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Keep silent, pray God and live the result to God.

124
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Now God will certainly take action because the case is now in the court of God.

125
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 God is the ruler of this entire world on any day.

126
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 If the revenge is not taken, if the fellow is not punished,

127
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 it is a black mark on the administration of God.

128
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 He will go and worry, why should you worry about his administration?

129
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Moreover, if he is punished, you are not getting your loss compensated.

130
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Moreover, another third point is that if you show revenge, vengeance attitude,

131
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 revenge attitude on that fellow, what happens you know?

132
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 For your revenge attitude, you will be also punished by God.

133
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 God will punish him, but extra you will be also punished for your revengeful attitude.

134
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Best example, you know Draupadi, injustice was done to Draupadi.

135
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 The Kauravas dragged her chavi and tried to make her naked.

136
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 So Kauravas are sinners. Draupadi is the victim. Kauravas are the criminals.

137
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Krishna has decided, God has decided to punish Kauravas.

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 But meanwhile, Draupadi showed a lot of revenge attitude towards Kauravas.

139
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 She was always weeping and crying and telling Bhima and Arjuna that

140
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 unless you kill Dushyasana, bring blood, I will not fold my heel.

141
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Like that, she was always expressing vengeance, revenge attitude towards the sinners.

142
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Anyway, for the sin of Kauravas, Kauravas were killed by Krishna.

143
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Arjuna and Pandavas are only just nominal, namke vastha people, that's all.

144
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Actually the killer is only Krishna.

145
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Krishna killed Kauravas and Shri Suntara.

146
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Draupadi was always showing vengeance, revenge attitude.

147
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 What happened you know, in the last day, all the five sons of Draupadi were also killed by Ashwatham.

148
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 What is the use of winning the war?

149
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 If she won the war, her sons will become the kings.

150
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Then only it has meaning.

151
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 So along with Kauravas, her five sons were killed and no son of Draupadi became the king.

152
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 The kingdom which was won by the war.

153
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 So therefore, if it is a retarded case, if you have treated him in the previous birth,

154
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 now he has treated, cancels, no more punishment for the criminals.

155
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 If it is not retarded case, if it is a fresh case, that is you have not treated him in the previous birth,

156
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 but now he has treated you, then also you don't show any revenge attitude towards your enemy.

157
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 You just pray God, asking him to do whatever he feels is right.

158
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Whatever is to be done, you please do.

159
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 You leave everything to God and pray God.

160
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Then God will give you compensation for your loss, plus God will punish them.

161
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 But God will punish them not for revenge, your revenge or he has no revenge.

162
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 He punishes them only for reformation, to reform the criminal.

163
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 That is the aim of punishment.

164
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And moreover, if he is punished and if God is not compensating your loss,

165
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 what is the use of punishing your criminals?

166
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 What compensation you got? You got no compensation.

167
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 So by punishing your enemy, you will not get any compensation.

168
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 So don't think of punishing your enemy.

169
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Leave it to God. God will punish your enemy and will also,

170
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 because you did not show any revenge attitude, he will compensate your loss.

171
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 That is the real benefit.

172
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Otherwise, if you show the attitude of vengeance, what happens?

173
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Your enemy will be punished, if it is not a retards case.

174
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 But you will not be compensated by God.

175
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And by punishing your enemy, did you get compensation? Nothing.

176
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 So, wisdom wise people, what they do, they never make any revengeful attitude.

177
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 They will never show revengeful attitude.

178
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 They keep silent, leaving everything to the hands of God.

179
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 This is your administration. You do whatever you want to do.

180
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 It is the administration of God.

181
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 If that fellow is really a criminal and if that criminal is not punished,

182
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 the black mark will come to God.

183
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Because it is God's administration that is going on everywhere,

184
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 not these governments which are present.

185
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 These are only superficial governments.

186
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 But the actual final judgement is given by God and things will happen as per that judgement.

187
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 So, that is the best thing.

188
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I will tell you in Telugu.

189
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Good.

190
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Someone asked me what should I do?

191
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Should I fight with the people who are shooting me?

192
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Or should I sit quietly?

193
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 This is the question that Mr. Ali asked.

194
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 What I am saying is, this could have been a retort case.

195
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 In the previous life, you might have cheated him.

196
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 But in this life, he has cheated you.

197
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 We thought it was a retort case.

198
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 You could have punished him.

199
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Because you did what he did and he cancelled the meeting.

200
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 So, there would have been no further action.

201
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 That is the proof for that.

202
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 You would have been hurt then.

203
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 The second thing is, it could have been a fresh case, not a retort case.

204
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 You didn't cheat him.

205
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 But he cheated you in this life.

206
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 If you cheat him in this life,

207
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 you would have been angry and would have said,

208
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 You would have said,

209
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 You should be punished with your life.

210
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 You would have been hurt.

211
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 The problem here is,

212
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 If you punish him,

213
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 will your loss be fulfilled?

214
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Will you get compensation for your loss?

215
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 You will get it, right?

216
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 What is your profit if he punishes you?

217
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 So, you are trying to escape from him.

218
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 You will not get any profit if he punishes you.

219
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 You will not get any loss if you escape.

220
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 You will not get any new loss.

221
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 So, we thought about this.

222
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 What decision should we take?

223
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 We should leave the Lord.

224
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 We should pray to the Lord for your peace of mind.

225
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Not for his loss.

226
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 We should pray to the Lord for your peace of mind.

227
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 We should leave the Lord.

228
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Because the Lord is the King.

229
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 He is the final.

230
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 The government is the only one.

231
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 The government is the only one.

232
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 The underlying government is the only one.

233
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 The only government is the Lord.

234
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Jesus Christ says,

235
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 The kingdom of the universe is near.

236
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 The kingdom of the universe is the government of God.

237
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 That is always stable.

238
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 That is the only thing that is active.

239
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 It is the only thing that is active.

240
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So, if you leave it like that,

241
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 what will God do? He will punish you.

242
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Then why will he punish you?

243
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 You did not want to be punished, right?

244
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Why will he punish you?

245
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Because the Lord is not only the one who punishes you,

246
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 but also the one who changes your mind.

247
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 He is the one who reformates you.

248
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 He will punish you for reformation.

249
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 So, how can you punish him?

250
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

251
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

252
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

253
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

254
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

255
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

256
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

257
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

258
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

259
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

260
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

261
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 If you say, you are a fool, he will punish you.

262
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Then,

263
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I can say, I am useless even if I get punished.

264
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 I can say, I am useless even if I get punished.

265
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 You should be calm.

266
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 You should be praying to God.

267
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 You should not be punished by force.

268
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 You should not be punished by force.

269
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 You should be calm.

270
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 God will make up for your loss.

271
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 If you stay like this,

272
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 the story of Draupadi is the story of Draupadi.

273
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Draupadi was insulted for a day.

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 She was wearing a dress and was wearing a turban.

275
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 So, for that, the Christians went and killed them.

276
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 They killed the Christians and they brought them back.

277
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Otherwise, they would have killed the other people.

278
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 The Ajayandu

279
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 asks Yasun

280
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 in the Drona Parvam.

281
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Yasun asks Yasun, if you want to die, say,

282
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Grandpa,

283
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 when I fight daily, I will throw arrows.

284
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 The enemy will die.

285
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 But when I shoot arrows,

286
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 before my arrow reaches him,

287
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 a great man will take Trishala and kill him.

288
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 After he dies, my arrow will reach him.

289
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 The great man will ask,

290
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 the Lord said,

291
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 you prayed for the holy weapon,

292
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 but the Lord is killing your enemies every day.

293
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 The great man is killing them.

294
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 That is why

295
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 God will punish them.

296
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 He will definitely punish them.

297
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 You should not be punished by force.

298
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I am talking about the Drona Parvam.

299
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 They have done a great sin.

300
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 The great man decided to kill the Christians and he killed them.

301
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Why did the great man keep his mouth open?

302
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 He kept his mouth open.

303
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 When will you kill the Christians?

304
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 When will you kill them?

305
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 When will you kill them?

306
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 When will you kill them?

307
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 When will you kill them?

308
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 He kept his mouth open.

309
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 When the Christians put their mouth open,

310
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 they killed the Christians.

311
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 He kept his mouth open.

312
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 He was not at peace.

313
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 He killed five children.

314
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Last day, Ashwathamang.

315
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 He came to the temple.

316
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 He killed five children.

317
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 These children should rule the world.

318
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 What is the value of killing?

319
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 All these children died.

320
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 That is why you will be punished.

321
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 But the mouth is open.

322
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 The mouth is open.

323
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Be at peace.

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 This is the kingdom of God.

325
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 This is the administration.

326
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 If the one who committed the sin does not repent,

327
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 the next black mouth God will come.

328
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Why will you come, Ashwathamang?

329
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 The next black mouth God will come.

330
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 He will keep his mouth open.

331
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 He is the real worry.

332
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 He should be worried.

333
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Not you.

334
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 You should be worried about the black mouth God.

335
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 You should be worried about the black mouth God.

336
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 You should be worried about the black mouth God.

337
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 When you are at peace,

338
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 you should not seek punishment.

339
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 You should be at peace.

340
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 You should not seek punishment.

341
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I have cheated him in my past life.

342
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 He cheated me in my future life.

343
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 He is the real worry.

344
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 He is the real worry.

345
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 He is the real worry.

346
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 He is the real worry.

347
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 He is the real worry.

348
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 He is the real worry.

349
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 He is the real worry.

350
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 He is the real worry.

351
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 He is the real worry.

352
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He is the real worry.

353
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 He is the real worry.

354
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 He is the real worry.

355
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 He is the real worry.

356
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 He is the real worry.

357
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 He is the real worry.

358
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 He is the real worry.

359
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 He is the real worry.

360
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 He is the real worry.

361
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 This is true.

362
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 He said,

363
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 You are at peace.

364
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 You shouldn't seek punishment.

365
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 You owe God compensation

366
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 and let them suffer.

367
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Now let me know what you want.

368
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Also,

369
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 you'll lose the power

370
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 That is the responsibility of a God.

371
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 To save the one who has done wrong, to save the one who has sinned, that is the responsibility of a God.

372
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He is the one who is the rightful owner. He will fulfill it.

373
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 You are the one who is the rightful owner. If you fulfill it, then what is left?

374
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 So, if you stay in the middle of it and do not increase the value of the money,

375
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 and pray to God in peace, then he will take it.

376
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Then the case will be yours.

377
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 There is no case against you.

378
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 If you stay like that, he will compensate for the loss you have caused.

379
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 That is the benefit.

380
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 If you stay like that, he will compensate for the loss you have caused.

381
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 If you do not compensate, then you will be punished.

382
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 That is the question he asked.

383
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Question from the audience.

384
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Swami, you have taken the Shorastra avatar, right?

385
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I have not.

386
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 I have taken the Dattva avatar.

387
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 I have taken this Kasai avatar and taken this avatar.

388
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 I used to wear a laban shirt and be a professor in college.

389
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 I have taken this avatar and taken this avatar.

390
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 In the book of Saraswati Swami,

391
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 In the book of Saraswati Swami,

392
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 There are many such small avatars, right?

393
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Yogi Raja, Atrivaludu.

394
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Yes, I have written it in Spanish. Tell me.

395
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 What is the meaning of that?

396
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 See, tell me the question and the time will be enough.

397
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 You can meet me anytime and I will give you the answer.

398
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Give me the time.

399
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Swami, my question is,

400
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 You are a physics expert, right?

401
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Sir, physics is a subject, right? I will tell you the answer.

402
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 The heat.

403
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 In the heat, light or in the matter of matter, there is a doubt.

404
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I do not understand.

405
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 He will tell you the answer.

406
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 I have told you the subject of the magadha of the phoebe.

407
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 She is not a doubt.

408
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Swami ji, the human incarnation of God is compared to sugar and the devotee is compared to ant.

409
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 You mean Ramakrishna.

410
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Ramakrishna.

411
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Swami, in other context, even a prostitute also can be compared as sugar and the...

412
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Prostitute is sugar.

413
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Even the Shiva is a sex disease.

414
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Syphilis, daniriyan, parapsak, even the ears.

415
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Ok, tell me.

416
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 That is...

417
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 What is your doubt?

418
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Even in prostitution, they also sing good songs to the Lord.

419
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Now, I am saying that the gopikas are sages in previous births.

420
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 So, in the last birth, they will sacrifice their bodies to the Lord.

421
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 In the same inni vrutthi case, if a prostitute wants to get liberated, why...

422
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 When her prostitute is in that state, why should she use that money for her work? Why should she not get liberated?

423
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 See...

424
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 In the last birth, someone killed a goat.

425
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 The goat was killed and made a baby.

426
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 The goat was skinned, beaten and given to the Brahmin.

427
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Is the baby going to die?

428
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 The goat was killed, skinned, beaten and donated to the Brahmin.

429
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Oh my God, I thought my baby was dead.

430
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 So, prostitution is a sin.

431
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Now, prostitution is a sin.

432
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 I am singing good songs to the Lord.

433
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I am a sinner.

434
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 I am a sinner.

435
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 I am a sinner.

436
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 If you give that money to the prostitute, she will be saved.

437
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 We earn according to our religion.

438
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 We earn according to our religion.

439
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Our family members also earn.

440
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 They come up.

441
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 This is the book of Injustice.

442
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Injustice is the law of the universe.

443
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 You earned 10 rupees in justice.

444
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:03,599
 Injustice is a

445
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

446
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

447
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

448
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

449
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

450
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

451
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

452
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

453
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,599
 I earned 10 rupees in justice.

454
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,599
 We earn according to our religion.

455
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,599
 We earn according to our religion.

456
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,599
 We earn according to our religion.

457
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,599
 We earn according to our religion.

458
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,599
 We earn according to our religion.

459
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,599
 We earn according to our religion.

460
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,599
 We earn according to our religion.

461
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,599
 We earn according to our religion.

462
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,599
 We earn according to our religion.

463
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,599
 Why do we earn?

464
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,599
 Because we earn for our children.

465
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,599
 That is the only desire.

466
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,599
 It does not happen.

467
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,599
 They get destroyed.

468
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:09,599
 Later,

469
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,599
 until that money is lost,

470
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,599
 until that money is lost,

471
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,599
 they get destroyed.

472
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,599
 So,

473
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,599
 it is the attraction of the village.

474
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,599
 If you look at the clothes,

475
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,599
 if you look at the beauty,

476
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,599
 if you look at the beauty,

477
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,599
 you get attracted to the beauty.

478
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,599
 The money is attracted to the beauty.

479
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,599
 But,

480
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,599
 it gets destroyed when it is lost.

481
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,599
 If they get destroyed,

482
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,599
 everyone gets destroyed.

483
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,599
 Because,

484
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,599
 the people who get the money,

485
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,599
 get destroyed.

486
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,599
 So,

487
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,599
 we should not earn unjustly.

488
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,599
 If we earn in a way,

489
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,599
 it is right.

490
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,599
 If we give it to God,

491
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,599
 if God always saves it,

492
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,599
 if God always accepts it,

493
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,599
 then you are unjust from then onwards.

494
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,599
 Realization, repentance and non-repetition are the same.

495
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,599
 If these three are combined, it is reformation.

496
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,599
 You have realized that this is a sin.

497
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,599
 Repentance,

498
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,599
 this sin is a sin.

499
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,599
 Non-repetition,

500
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,599
 you should not repeat the sin of the mother.

501
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,599
 Then,

502
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,599
 all the sins that are done behind,

503
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,599
 are all cancer.

504
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:39,599
 All cancer.

505
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,599
 If you do three,

506
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,599
 some people do realization, repentance and non-repetition.

507
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,599
 But if you do the four,

508
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,599
 and if you do the five,

509
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,599
 then you can forgive in the evening.

510
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,599
 If you do the six,

511
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,599
 then you can forgive in the morning.

512
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,599
 If you do the seven,

513
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,599
 is it free?

514
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,599
 If you do the eight,

515
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:05,599
 you can forgive in the evening.

516
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:07,599
 You should not do the eight,

517
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,599
 and you will not eat the food.

518
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,599
 You should not eat the food.

519
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,599
 Is it clean?

520
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,599
 Is it pure?

521
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,599
 That is the principle.

522
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,599
 It works.

523
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,599
 Non-repetition of this in

524
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,599
 realization.

525
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,599
 You know it is a sin,

526
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,599
 you are suffering for it.

527
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,599
 You understand it

528
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,599
 as if you are not being amazed.

529
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,599
 After this,

530
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,599
 that sin will come.

531
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,599
 What are those sins?

532
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,599
 Everything will be forgotten.

533
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,599
 Everything.

534
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,599
 All the sins

535
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,599
 that were done previously.

536
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,599
 Not all sins,

537
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,599
 but those types of sins.

538
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,599
 You have committed a theft,

539
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,599
 you know it,

540
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,599
 you have done non-repetition

541
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,599
 without committing a theft.

542
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,599
 If you want to steal,

543
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,599
 you get cancer.

544
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,599
 But there are other types

545
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,599
 of sins,

546
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,599
 right?

547
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,599
 If you do that type of non-repetition,

548
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,599
 you get cancer.

549
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,599
 If you don't do

550
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,599
 anything,

551
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,599
 you get cancer.

552
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,599
 So,

553
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,599
 the non-repetition

554
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,599
 is not done again.

555
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,599
 It is life load.

556
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,599
 When it is realized,

557
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,599
 the whole process is completed.

558
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,599
 But what are they doing?

559
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,599
 Many are going to

560
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,599
 realization, repentance,

561
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,599
 confession.

562
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,599
 The boy who did it in the morning,

563
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,599
 science and confession.

564
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,599
 The other day, the confession.

565
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,599
 That is not it.

566
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,599
 What is the answer?

567
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,599
 The sin of being cancelled

568
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,599
 because of confession.

569
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,599
 Non-repetition.

570
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,599
 If you don't do it again,

571
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,599
 all those types of sins will be cancelled.

572
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,599
 The other day,

573
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,599
 all those types of sins will be cancelled.

574
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,599
 The logic behind it is

575
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,599
 that all the sins are being cancelled.

576
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,599
 The intention behind the sin

577
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,599
 is to perform the reformation.

578
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,599
 When you perform the reformation,

579
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,599
 why do you need more sins?

580
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,599
 When you have already

581
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,599
 realized it,

582
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,599
 you don't need to do it again.

583
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,599
 That is the logic.

584
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,599
 Punishment is only for reformation

585
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,599
 and punishment is not for vengeance.

586
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,599
 Punishment is not for vengeance.

587
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,599
 Reformation is not for revenge.

588
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,599
 Reformation is not for revenge.

589
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,599
 Reformation is not for revenge.

590
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,599
 Reformation is not for revenge.

591
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,599
 Someone was killed.

592
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,599
 He is being tortured.

593
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,599
 Do you know why?

594
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,599
 Because he is not killing the other person.

595
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,599
 If someone is really not killing the other person,

596
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,599
 what is the use of torturing him?

597
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,599
 How can we waste time?

598
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,599
 Torture?

599
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,599
 That is the logic.

600
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,599
 Okay.

601
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,599
 Namaste, Swamiji.

602
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,599
 Namaste.

603
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,599
 I am from Mumbai.

604
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,599
 Yes, yes. Tell me.

605
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,599
 On this auspicious Guru Gurunima day,

606
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,599
 I offer my sincere gratitude

607
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,599
 and a total prostrated pranam

608
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,599
 to your divine rotorspeak.

609
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,599
 Okay, thank you.

610
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,599
 And to my appeal,

611
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,599
 guiding my weak and undist mind,

612
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,599
 you had said that I assured you

613
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,599
 you will succeed in getting your problem cured.

614
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,599
 Your words came true in all aspects of my mental health.

615
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,599
 Let us begin.

616
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,599
 I have been telling you recently on my query

617
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,599
 on my better health condition,

618
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,599
 you have said you will get my guidance

619
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,599
 as you proceed in the work.

620
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,599
 But I also wanted to go in the direction of God,

621
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,599
 which is a permanent solution.

622
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,599
 And there you have also said

623
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,599
 you will have to face a lot of strain

624
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,599
 in working for God.

625
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,599
 Kindly elaborate further on this

626
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,599
 as I am ready to go to any extent to prove

627
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,599
 that I could come close to you,

628
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,599
 come close to you, Swamiji, in my life.

629
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,599
 Okay, very good.

630
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,599
 You are blessed.

631
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,599
 Thank you, Swamiji.

632
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,599
 You will get proper guidance.

633
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,599
 You need not do too much work also.

634
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,599
 You need not do.

635
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,599
 You can do as per your health permits,

636
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,599
 as per your capacity permits,

637
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,599
 as per your energy permits.

638
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,599
 That is sufficient for God.

639
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,599
 That is sufficient for God.

640
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,599
 Whether you are interested in doing

641
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,599
 practical work for my case or not,

642
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,599
 that is only the test of God.

643
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,599
 He is not in need of any work from us.

644
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,599
 If there is any need,

645
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,599
 then the fellow will think,

646
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,599
 if he does more work,

647
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,599
 my work will be more done.

648
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,599
 Not like that.

649
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,599
 God is only testing

650
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,599
 whether you are only theoretical

651
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,599
 or practical.

652
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,599
 Also, practical is the proof for theory.

653
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,599
 Practical devotion is the proof

654
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,599
 for theoretical devotion.

655
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,599
 Theoretical devotion without practical devotion

656
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,599
 is a false love.

657
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,599
 It is not true love.

658
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,599
 Unless you sacrifice something practically,

659
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,599
 unless you do some service practically,

660
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,599
 service means sacrifice of energy,

661
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,599
 physical energy,

662
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,599
 sacrifice of fruit of work.

663
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,599
 That is first is Karma Sanyasa,

664
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,599
 another is Karma Parachyaka.

665
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,599
 Both these together are called as Karma Yoga.

666
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,599
 Karma Yoga is the proof for Bhagya Yoga.

667
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,599
 Bhakti Yoga is theoretical devotion.

668
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,599
 Bhakti Yoga is theoretical devotion.

669
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,599
 Karma Yoga is practical devotion.

670
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,599
 Practical devotion is the proof for

671
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,599
 the truth of theoretical devotion.

672
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,599
 Whether your bhakti is real or false,

673
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,599
 that Karma Yoga decides.

674
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,599
 The practical devotion decides.

675
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,599
 Very simply,

676
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,599
 guess, you may sing so many songs,

677
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,599
 shed tears,

678
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,599
 then God will say,

679
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,599
 He will also sing songs on you,

680
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,599
 He will also shed tears,

681
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,599
 or if you want a boon from that,

682
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,599
 oh, you get more sweeter voice,

683
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,599
 He will let you get more tears from your eyes.

684
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,599
 So for theoretical devotion, theoretical boon.

685
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,599
 For practical devotion, practical boon.

686
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,599
 So actually in our India,

687
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,599
 we are very, very much, very highly

688
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,599
 experts in theoretical devotion.

689
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,599
 That is why once somebody asked,

690
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,599
 Swami Vivekananda looked at this Thay

691
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,599
 and asked God,

692
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,599
 why in our country, in India,

693
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,599
 so much devotion, so much knowledge is there,

694
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,599
 but still why they are poor?

695
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,599
 Somebody has put that question to me,

696
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,599
 directed that question to me.

697
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,599
 Then I told, yes,

698
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,599
 our India is very great in knowledge,

699
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:58,599
 spiritual knowledge, Gnana Yoga,

700
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:01,599
 and experts in Bhakti Yoga,

701
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,599
 singing songs on God,

702
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:09,599
 but will not give a single rupee for a poor fellow.

703
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,599
 In practical devotion, they are zero.

704
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,599
 In foreign countries,

705
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,599
 they are least Gnana Yoga,

706
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,599
 very least Bhakti Yoga,

707
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,599
 but they do charity, practical charity,

708
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,599
 they do much.

709
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,599
 That is why they are rich countries,

710
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,599
 our country is poor country.

711
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,599
 That is the reason.

712
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,599
 We are experts in theoretical devotion,

713
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,599
 theoretical knowledge.

714
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,599
 So for theoretical knowledge and theoretical devotion,

715
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,599
 God gives theoretical boons.

716
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,599
 Let your knowledge increase more,

717
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,599
 let your knowledge increase more,

718
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,599
 let your brain become more intelligent,

719
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,599
 let your voice become more sweet,

720
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,599
 let more tears come while you sing,

721
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,599
 like your audience also,

722
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,599
 shed tears,

723
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,599
 more tears.

724
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,599
 So theoretical devotion means theoretical boons.

725
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,599
 In whatever way you approach me,

726
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,599
 I am your God.

727
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,599
 So, I am your God.

728
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,599
 I am your God.

729
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,599
 So, I am your God.

730
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,599
 If you approach me,

731
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,599
 I approach you again by the same way.

732
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,599
 If you come by bus, I will come by bus.

733
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,599
 If you come by train, I will come by train.

734
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,599
 If you come by airplane, I will come by airplane.

735
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,599
 In letter of the scripture,

736
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,599
 I am just your reflection,

737
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,599
 your mirror reflection.

738
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,599
 Whatever way you approach,

739
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,599
 if you show your intelligence,

740
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,599
 I will show lot of intelligence.

741
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,599
 It will give you fruit.

742
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,599
 If you show innocence,

743
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,599
 I will be also innocent.

744
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,599
 Hedonism asked that he should not be killed by such things,

745
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,599
 either day or night, or inside or outside,

746
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,599
 or weapons with awareness or without awareness,

747
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,599
 like that, so many conditions.

748
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,599
 All the conditions he has broken,

749
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,599
 and for every condition he neutralized,

750
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,599
 and killed Hedonism.

751
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,599
 He should not belong to a single race,

752
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,599
 man or animal,

753
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,599
 Deva or Asura,

754
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,599
 Gantara, Narasimha,

755
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,599
 neither man nor animal,

756
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,599
 neither inside nor outside,

757
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,599
 at the center of the gate,

758
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,599
 it is neither outside nor inside,

759
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,599
 nor on the floor nor on the sky,

760
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,599
 he has put on his laps,

761
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,599
 neither floor nor on the sky.

762
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,599
 Like that, for every thing he has shown,

763
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,599
 what the exception.

764
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,599
 He is very intelligent.

765
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,599
 You show your intelligence to other human beings,

766
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,599
 but when you come before God,

767
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,599
 kindly shut up your intelligence.

768
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,599
 Be innocent.

769
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,599
 Be frank with him.

770
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,599
 Don't show your intelligence.

771
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,599
 If he enters into the game,

772
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,599
 your address will not be there.

773
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,599
 So don't play with him.

774
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,599
 Be true.

775
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,599
 Be frank, be sincere,

776
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,599
 be truthful.

777
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,599
 Then you will get something from him.

778
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,599
 If you show intelligence,

779
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,599
 finish him.

780
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,599
 So you see Sudama,

781
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,599
 how innocent he is.

782
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,599
 He gave three handful of parched rice,

783
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,599
 did not ask anything.

784
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,599
 He came back to his house,

785
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,599
 he never thought about anything,

786
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,599
 he retired from him,

787
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,599
 and when he came back to his house,

788
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,599
 unimaginable wealth he gave.

789
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,599
 Because he is innocent.

790
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,599
 See, his wife sent him to Krishna

791
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,599
 to get something.

792
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,599
 He was so poor.

793
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,599
 But the fellow did not speak anything.

794
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,599
 Krishna asked him to stay for four days,

795
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,599
 he stayed for four days,

796
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,599
 then he told, I will go to my home.

797
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,599
 Yes, he said, go.

798
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,599
 Like that he told.

799
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,599
 He did not give any one rupee.

800
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,599
 When he was washing his feet,

801
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,599
 when he came,

802
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,599
 there was a thorn in his feet.

803
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,599
 He was not having the sensitivity of that thorn.

804
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,599
 He was not having any chappals to his feet.

805
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,599
 So when he came and when he was washing,

806
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,599
 all his eight vices were pouring water,

807
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,599
 and he was washing his feet,

808
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,599
 and the thorn hit his palm.

809
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,599
 Then he plucked out.

810
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:13,599
 He plucked out and from that time onwards,

811
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,599
 there was no need of the eight vices to pour water

812
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,599
 with gold vessels,

813
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,599
 because

814
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,599
 from that time onwards,

815
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,599
 he washed his feet with his tears.

816
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,599
 Water was not necessary.

817
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,599
 Satchakrishna,

818
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,599
 he doesn't have any chappals.

819
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,599
 Now he is going back to his home.

820
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,599
 Hey, Sudama, wait.

821
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,599
 At least take this ten rupees.

822
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,599
 Purchase some second-hand chappals.

823
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,599
 He should give it or not?

824
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,599
 No, not a single rupee he gave.

825
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,599
 He also started again working with barefoot feet.

826
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,599
 And as long as he was going to his house,

827
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,599
 Krishna, he has the miraculous powers.

828
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,599
 He is observing the mind of Sudama.

829
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,599
 There were somewhere,

830
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,599
 that fellow,

831
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,599
 he has wrapped,

832
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,599
 seeing my feet,

833
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,599
 while washing the feet.

834
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,599
 And when I am coming,

835
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,599
 one rupee he has not given.

836
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,599
 He acted like an Hollywood hero.

837
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,599
 Acted?

838
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,599
 Unseen that thought.

839
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,599
 Now one rupee he has not given.

840
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,599
 Like that, whether he is saying in his mind,

841
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,599
 he was observing his mind.

842
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,599
 He has got the capacity, you know.

843
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,599
 He is omni-quotient.

844
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,599
 He is not a person.

845
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,599
 He is a person.

846
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,599
 Till he went near to his house,

847
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,599
 the house remained like that only.

848
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,599
 Just when he is approaching his house,

849
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,599
 he bent his head and he is approaching his house.

850
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,599
 Then suddenly, now he will not scold Krishna.

851
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,599
 He decided, Krishna.

852
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,599
 At that moment,

853
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,599
 he changed his mind.

854
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,599
 The house became a big palace.

855
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,599
 It was not done immediately.

856
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,599
 He waited there,

857
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,599
 till he reached in the house,

858
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,599
 whether he will scold me once or not.

859
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,599
 If he had his scolding once,

860
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,599
 his house will remain as that also.

861
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,599
 Swamiji, Namaskaram Swamiji.

862
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,599
 Few minutes back, you answered about

863
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,599
 not having the revengeable attitude

864
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,599
 when someone cheats us.

865
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,599
 So, let us take one example.

866
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,599
 If someone cheats me by stealing some money,

867
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,599
 so, if I file a complaint in police,

868
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,599
 is that also a revengeable attitude

869
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,599
 or is it justified?

870
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,599
 No, that is not a revengeable attitude

871
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,599
 because you don't know

872
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,599
 whether it is a retarded case or a fresh case.

873
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,599
 So, there,

874
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,599
 when I have taken the case of Draupadi,

875
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,599
 that situation is completely different.

876
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,599
 She cannot fight by filing

877
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,599
 a case in court

878
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,599
 because it was the king,

879
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,599
 Duryodhana was the king.

880
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,599
 Is it not?

881
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,599
 So, what I tell is

882
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,599
 the case,

883
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,599
 the circumstances

884
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,599
 in which you cannot do anything,

885
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,599
 any reaction,

886
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,599
 you are unable to take any reaction.

887
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,599
 You are unable to take any reaction.

888
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,599
 Very big fellow.

889
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,599
 You cannot fight with him.

890
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,599
 You see, compare

891
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,599
 Draupadi and Duryodhana.

892
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,599
 They are very powerful.

893
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,599
 She is ready.

894
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,599
 She cannot fight.

895
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,599
 So, that is the circumstances I told.

896
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,599
 If there is anything

897
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,599
 that you can do,

898
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,599
 you do it. But sometimes,

899
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:03,599
 you cannot fight.

900
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,599
 That fellow may be very big,

901
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,599
 rowdy.

902
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,599
 He may say, if you go to

903
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,599
 police station or court,

904
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,599
 you will be finished.

905
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,599
 Then you will not go.

906
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,599
 Then what to do?

907
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,599
 Okay?

908
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,599
 Thank you.

909
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,599
 One more question.

910
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,599
 That same question, Swamiji.

911
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,599
 But we will be having

912
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,599
 like a pain or like hurt

913
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,599
 or pain in the heart.

914
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,599
 Like a pain or like hurt

915
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,599
 like that person has

916
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,599
 did these things with me.

917
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,599
 So, we were getting suffering

918
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,599
 from those pain,

919
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,599
 not that person who has

920
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,599
 done the cheating and all.

921
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,599
 So...

922
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,599
 See, if you can

923
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,599
 fight, you fight out.

924
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,599
 If you are cheated by somebody,

925
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,599
 and if there is provision for you

926
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,599
 to fight,

927
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,599
 you fight.

928
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,599
 That is not wrong.

929
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,599
 Suppose there is no provision

930
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,599
 to fight. Suppose that

931
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,599
 fellow is very powerful.

932
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,599
 You are not so much powerful.

933
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,599
 Suppose he says, if you fight, I will

934
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,599
 kill you.

935
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,599
 And we all are encouraged also, you

936
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,599
 found that he is capable of

937
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,599
 doing that.

938
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,599
 In those occupations,

939
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,599
 I told like this.

940
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,599
 But if you are able

941
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,599
 to fight,

942
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,599
 and you are not

943
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,599
 fighting, you are sitting like Arjuna

944
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,599
 in the Kurukshetra war,

945
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,599
 what Krishna told to Arjuna?

946
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,599
 You fight.

947
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,599
 See, you have got some army,

948
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,599
 they have got some army.

949
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,599
 He came to the war

950
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,599
 to fight.

951
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,599
 Then you fight.

952
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,599
 He did not say, go back.

953
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,599
 He was going to throw

954
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,599
 on the bar,

955
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,599
 and keep silent.

956
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,599
 I was dead.

957
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,599
 He did not tell like that.

958
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,599
 Hello?

959
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,599
 Yes, Amiji.

960
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,599
 See, if you have permission to fight,

961
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,599
 if you have chance to fight,

962
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,599
 you must fight.

963
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,599
 If there is no such provision,

964
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,599
 if the enemy is very strong,

965
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,599
 and suppose

966
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,599
 threatens that he will kill you,

967
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:41,599
 and on enquiry

968
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,599
 he also found that he is capable

969
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,599
 of such thing,

970
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,599
 then you

971
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,599
 approach God.

972
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,599
 Not about Amiji, then?

973
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,599
 What about then

974
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,599
 in relations kind of?

975
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,599
 Like how?

976
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,599
 There we can't fight, like

977
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,599
 if that person did this with us, then?

978
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,599
 What relation you mean?

979
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,599
 When he has cheated you,

980
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,599
 when he has cheated you,

981
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,599
 what type of relationship you can have with him?

982
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,599
 No relation.

983
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,599
 You should cut off all relations.

984
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,599
 He is a cheat.

985
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,599
 He has cheated you.

986
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,599
 If you maintain all relations,

987
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,599
 he again cheat you.

988
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,599
 See, when you are

989
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,599
 cooking the food rice,

990
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,599
 you take one

991
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,599
 grain and press it

992
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,599
 whether it is cooked or not.

993
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,599
 Is it not?

994
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,599
 So one example is sufficient.

995
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,599
 The entire rice is represented by that one grain.

996
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,599
 His entire rice is represented by that one example.

997
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,599
 Padi Namaskaram Swami.

998
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,599
 Yes.

999
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,599
 Is wanting liberation an act of aspiration

1000
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,599
 though it is not worldly?

1001
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,599
 As long as God is a fruit at the end,

1002
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,599
 then it is not a sin.

1003
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,599
 It is a sin.

1004
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,599
 As long as God is a fruit at the end,

1005
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,599
 we would be aspiring to reach Him.

1006
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,599
 So how should we approach God, Swami?

1007
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,599
 He is wanting

1008
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,599
 liberation

1009
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,599
 and act of aspiration

1010
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,599
 though it is not worldly.

1011
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,599
 As long as God is the fruit

1012
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,599
 at the end, we would be aspiring

1013
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,599
 to reach Him.

1014
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,599
 So how should we approach God, Swami?

1015
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,599
 See, you are talking about liberation

1016
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,599
 and reaching God.

1017
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,599
 Is it not?

1018
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,599
 Attachment to God

1019
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,599
 and detachment from

1020
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,599
 liberation means detachment

1021
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,599
 from worldly bonds.

1022
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,599
 Detachment from worldly

1023
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,599
 and attachment to God.

1024
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,599
 Here they are very much related.

1025
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,599
 Unless you attach

1026
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,599
 to God, you

1027
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,599
 cannot liberate yourself from

1028
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,599
 the variety.

1029
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,599
 If you want to have some

1030
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,599
 detachment from something,

1031
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,599
 you must attach

1032
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,599
 yourself to some other thing.

1033
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,599
 Then the detachment

1034
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,599
 will be spontaneous.

1035
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,599
 Automatically you will be detached.

1036
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,599
 Suppose you are sitting in a cinema

1037
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,599
 hall. See in the cinema,

1038
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,599
 you are very much

1039
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,599
 absorbed in the cinema.

1040
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,599
 You are very much attached to the cinema

1041
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,599
 story.

1042
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,599
 Now, the mosquitoes

1043
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,599
 are biting.

1044
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,599
 The blood bugs of the seat,

1045
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,599
 they are also biting.

1046
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,599
 You need not try to

1047
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,599
 liberate from mosquitoes and

1048
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,599
 blood bugs.

1049
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,599
 If you are absorbed in the cinema,

1050
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,599
 you will not mind these bites.

1051
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:03,599
 You are automatically liberated.

1052
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,599
 So, the attachment to

1053
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,599
 God must be

1054
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,599
 the cause for your detachment

1055
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,599
 from the world.

1056
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,599
 Without attachment to

1057
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:17,599
 God, if you liberate

1058
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,599
 from the world, it is the

1059
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,599
 biggest foolishness.

1060
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,599
 See,

1061
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,599
 I am drinking divine nectar,

1062
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,599
 amrutam.

1063
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,599
 I am drinking it.

1064
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,599
 Then spontaneously,

1065
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:33,599
 automatically, I want to drink

1066
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:35,599
 coffee.

1067
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,599
 Before the taste of amrutam,

1068
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,599
 this is nothing.

1069
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:41,599
 I hate it.

1070
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,599
 I don't take it.

1071
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,599
 Because of the taste of

1072
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,599
 amrutam.

1073
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,599
 Neither you drink amrutam,

1074
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,599
 nor you drink coffee.

1075
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,599
 You are a fool.

1076
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,599
 At least if amrutam is not

1077
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,599
 available, let me drink coffee.

1078
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,599
 Something I have to drink.

1079
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,599
 That drinking habit is there

1080
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,599
 for this tongue

1081
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,599
 and for the mind.

1082
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,599
 The mind always wants to drink

1083
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,599
 something. The mind always wants

1084
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,599
 to attach itself to something.

1085
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,599
 That is its

1086
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,599
 inherent nature.

1087
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,599
 So, now

1088
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,599
 you are not attaching yourself to God.

1089
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,599
 You are also not

1090
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,599
 attaching yourself to the world.

1091
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,599
 Will mind keep silent?

1092
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:29,599
 In two, three days,

1093
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,599
 you will have double

1094
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,599
 attachment to the world.

1095
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,599
 It is not prerequisite.

1096
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,599
 To drink divine nectar,

1097
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,599
 there is no precondition

1098
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,599
 that you should not drink coffee.

1099
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,599
 It is not a pre-stipulated

1100
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,599
 condition.

1101
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,599
 If you drink divine nectar,

1102
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,599
 due to that taste,

1103
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,599
 you automatically,

1104
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,599
 spontaneously leave drinking coffee.

1105
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,599
 Such type of detachment

1106
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,599
 you should get.

1107
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,599
 Without drinking the divine nectar,

1108
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,599
 you want to

1109
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,599
 newly coffee.

1110
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,599
 Two days, three days you will leave.

1111
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,599
 On fourth day you will drink a bucket of coffee.

1112
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,599
 It is

1113
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,599
 impossible.

1114
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,599
 Detachment from the world

1115
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,599
 without attachment to God

1116
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,599
 is impossible

1117
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,599
 and also foolish

1118
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,599
 and also useless.

1119
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,599
 What is the use?

1120
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,599
 At least if that is not available,

1121
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,599
 you enjoy this.

1122
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,599
 You lose this.

1123
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,599
 You don't

1124
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,599
 enjoy that.

1125
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,599
 So, Moksha, liberation from the worldly bonds,

1126
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,599
 is defined as

1127
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,599
 the liberation from

1128
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,599
 the worldly bonds

1129
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,599
 due to the attachment to God.

1130
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,599
 That is very important.

1131
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,599
 You must attach to God.

1132
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,599
 Then you should not try for

1133
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,599
 liberation from the worldly bonds.

1134
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,599
 Auto-naturally it takes place.

1135
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,599
 It is a spontaneous by-product.

1136
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,599
 For which you need to try at all.

1137
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,599
 It is a natural

1138
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,599
 phenomenon. Naturally you will get

1139
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,599
 detachment.

1140
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,599
 You drink divine nectar.

1141
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,599
 Naturally you will be detached from coffee.

1142
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,599
 Such type of liberation

1143
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,599
 is Moksha.

1144
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,599
 You are not drinking divine nectar.

1145
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,599
 You are not attached to God.

1146
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,599
 You are leaving

1147
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,599
 the worldly bonds.

1148
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:37,599
 That is not Moksha at all.

1149
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,599
 It is only foolishness.

1150
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,599
 People leave the house and go to the forest

1151
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,599
 and

1152
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,599
 sit there in meditation.

1153
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,599
 They will be thinking only worldly things.

1154
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,599
 Then they will run back.

1155
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,599
 They will come back to home.

1156
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,599
 They will not come back. They will run.

1157
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,599
 Run that home.

1158
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,599
 Run that to the home.

1159
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,599
 In the death ritual

1160
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,599
 they put rice in a mud pot

1161
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,599
 and they put

1162
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,599
 some koudang in.

1163
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,599
 Raw rice and put koudang in it.

1164
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,599
 They take the dead body along

1165
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,599
 with that pot

1166
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:41,599
 and cremate it.

1167
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,599
 Regarding that one death ritual

1168
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,599
 Swamiji.

1169
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,599
 The other one is with

1170
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:51,599
 the tarpanam.

1171
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,599
 It is the conteration tarpanam.

1172
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,599
 They have black sesame seeds

1173
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,599
 and the raw rice

1174
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,599
 mixed.

1175
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:01,599
 We put in water and we do

1176
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,599
 tarpanam and that

1177
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,599
 rice and seeds should be thrown

1178
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,599
 in a place where it can't be

1179
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,599
 grown back.

1180
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,599
 Instruction has been given by

1181
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,599
 elders at my home.

1182
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,599
 The third one is

1183
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,599
 having a haven

1184
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,599
 for samitadhan, for brahmacharis

1185
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,599
 who have completed their

1186
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,599
 tarpanam.

1187
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,599
 After every sandhyamandhanam

1188
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,599
 samitadhanam is also

1189
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,599
 instructed to do for brahmacharis.

1190
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,599
 These three

1191
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,599
 rituals, clarifications

1192
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,599
 I need Swamiji further.

1193
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,599
 You see

1194
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,599
 there is one

1195
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,599
 shloka in dhama shastra

1196
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,599
 in the scripture itself.

1197
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,599
 When there is a contradiction between

1198
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,599
 smruthi and

1199
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:53,599
 shruti

1200
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,599
 then there is

1201
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,599
 a contradiction between

1202
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,599
 smruthi and

1203
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,599
 shruti.
