may exist or may not exist. In such 50-50 probability of existence and non-existence, it is better to take such possibility, which has the least risk. This point can be made clear by the following example: - a blind person is advised by somebody that there is fire in front of him in his path and somebody else is advising him that there is no fire before him in the path. In such 50-50 probability also, the best choice will be towards the least risk, which means that it is better that the blind person goes back believing that there is fire in the path before him. Even if the fire does not exist, there is no harm if the blind person goes back. If there is fire, the blind person will be terribly damaged. So, based on this 50-50 probability at least, it is better to believe in the existence of God and hell so that one can avoid the sins. By avoiding sins, even if the hell is absent there is no damage. In fact, if the sin is not done, there will be no tension and a healthy and peaceful happy life can be enjoyed as an extra benefit.] 

  

18) Vañcita nyāya pīṭhānāṃ, nohya daivābhayāmhasām । 
Nigrahāya pracāro vo, daivānugraha bhāginām ।। 

[In the present days, most people due to lack of faith in God and hell, commit sins by not caring courts and police stations, which can be corrupted. They think that if courts are fooled, there is no other force to punish their sins. By this, this society is becoming a chaos. If you are convinced with the above knowledge preached by Me, you must propagate all this knowledge among the modern people so that the society becomes very peaceful. Hence, you must reform the entire society apart from your self-reformation. By such propagation God will be pleased with you and bless you. You must make every citizen to fear for the sins since even if they fool courts the unimaginable God will punish the sin through unimaginable ways.] 

  

19) Jñānena pāpa nirbandhaḥ, prāgadya tat virodhataḥ । 
Prabhavo na nigṛhṇanti, sādhanairagha dūṣitaiḥ ।। 

[In ancient times, kings gave lot of importance to spiritual knowledge in the education system by making it compulsory to everybody so that every future citizen develops an inherent resistance towards sin assuming that even courts and police stations are absent. Everybody was sure that the unimaginable God will certainly punish the sin in unimaginable way and there was no need of any external agency to control the sin. Due to this reason, kings were not having any work of administration and were spending their time with fine arts during their stay in the royal courts or offices of administration. Today, the governments in the world have neglected spiritual education and concentrated on materialistic education only as a result of which they are unable to control the sin even by a trace because even the controlling systems have become corrupt.] 

  

20) Viśvenā'nagha śāntena, sa prīto jīvikāśrayāt । 
Anūhya vipado naiva, yābhyohyadhikamārjitam ।। 

[This entire earth shall become sinless and peaceful by which God will be really pleased to bless all of you while alive here as well as there after death. Propagate this spiritual knowledge without aspiring anything in return from God or from others. You must concentrate on earning wealth for your basic needs only and extra wealth shall not be aspired thinking that it will help you in unexpected problems in future. If you do this divine service, such unexpected problems will not approach you at all by the will of God so that there is no need of earning extra money, which will naturally attract you to do sins.]
