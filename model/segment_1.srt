1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:16

2
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
Ms. Trailokya, a sincere devotee,

3
00:00:20 --> 00:00:30
asks Shri Datta Swami several questions with very sharp analysis.

4
00:00:30 --> 00:00:40
Swami, pleased with her sharpness of intelligence, gave her a title “Opposition Leader”

5
00:00:40 --> 00:00:50
representing the present generation having high IQ due to tremendous development of scientific logic.

6
00:00:50 --> 00:01:00
The answers given by Swami are composed as Sanskrit verses by Swami in this

7
00:01:00 --> 00:01:10
Trailokya Gītā, which means not only the message given to the questions of Ms. Trailokya, but also

8
00:01:10 --> 00:01:22
means the divine message given to the three worlds. The English translation is also given by Swami Himself.

9
00:01:22 --> 00:02:24

10
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
Dattasvāmī Uvāca:-

11
00:02:27 --> 00:02:42
Ānandaṃ māmajānanto, nityaṃ cintā parāyanāḥ । 
Ime manuṣyā dhāvanti, karmayantreṇa cūrṇitāḥ ।।

12
00:02:42 --> 00:02:50
Shri Dattaswami spoke:- These human beings are always

13
00:02:50 --> 00:03:10
running in their lives filled with continuous worries, getting powdered by the mechanical worldly duties, without recognizing Me, the infinite bliss.

14
00:03:10 --> 00:03:25
Gurava stattva mutsṛjya, mano vaidyāyitā ssadā । 
Bodhayanti manaśśāstraṃ, bādhā śāntyai vinauṣadham ।। 

15
00:03:25 --> 00:03:36
These spiritual preachers are leaving entirely the spiritual knowledge

16
00:03:36 --> 00:03:45
which is about the details of divine personality of God. They have become pure professional

17
00:03:45 --> 00:04:00
psychiatrists preaching psychology involving the methods of temporary and superficial psychological cure to get momentary relief


18
00:04:00 --> 00:04:13
from mental stress attained from the punishments of sins without finding the root sin and its proper medicine

19
00:04:13 --> 00:04:30
Upāyadā ssvayaṃ vyaktā, Daivamūkā navāgatāḥ । 
Vijñā vijñārtha mandhatvāt, purāṇā daivikā iti ।। 

20
00:04:30 --> 00:04:40
These spiritual preachers keep silent about God as far as possible so that

21
00:04:40 --> 00:04:50
they project their personalities by giving the cure of stress. They feel that the ancient devotees

22
00:04:50 --> 00:05:00
were uneducated and ignorant by blindly becoming mad of God and feel that
