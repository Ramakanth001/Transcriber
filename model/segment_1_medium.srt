 Trilokya Gita Chapter 1

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,800
 Daivakartavya Yogaha Association with Divine Duty

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:30,600
 This Trilokya, a sincere devotee, asks Sri Dattaswami several questions with very sharp analysis.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 Swami pleased with her sharpness of intelligence gave her a title, opposition leader,

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:51,400
 representing the present generation having high IQ due to tremendous development of scientific logic.

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:01,400
 The answers given by Swami are composed as Sanskrit verses by Swami in this Trilokya Gita,

7
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:09,200
 which means not only the message given to the questions of Miss Trilokya,

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:17,200
 but also means the divine message given to the three worlds.

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,200
 The English translation is also given by Swami Himself.

 Kimetasya chasadhanam

13
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,799
 Miss Trilokya asked,

14
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,799
 O Dattaswami, O Lord of spiritual preachers,

15
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:05,799
 O human incarnation of God Dattatreya,

16
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,800
 what is the ultimate goal of this human life of ours?

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,600
 Also, what is the path for attaining that ultimate goal?

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 Dattaswami uvacha Anandamma majananto

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600

 Karma yantre na churnitaha

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 Sri Dattaswami spoke,

23
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,400
 These human beings are always running in their lives,

24
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
 filled with continuous worries,

25
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,400
 getting powdered by the mechanical worldly duties

26
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,400
 without recognizing Me, the infinite bliss.

27
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,200
 Dhuravasattva mutsrujya Mano vaijya itasada

28
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:24,200
 Bodhayanti manashyastram Padasyanchay vinushadham

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:33,200
 These spiritual preachers are leaving entirely the spiritual knowledge

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 which is about the details of the divine personality of God.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 They have become pure professional psychiatrists

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 preaching psychology involving the methods of temporary and superficial psychological cure

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 to get momentary relief from mental stress.

34
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:10,800
 Attained from the punishments of sins without finding the root sin and its proper medicine.

35
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 Upayadha swayam yattah Daivamukha navagatah

36
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 Vijnna vijnna dhavandhatva Rana daivika iti

37
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 These spiritual preachers keep silent about God as far as possible

38
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,600
 so that they project their personalities by giving the cure of stress.

39
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 They feel that the ancient devotees were uneducated and ignorant

40
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,400
 by blindly becoming mad of God and feel that
