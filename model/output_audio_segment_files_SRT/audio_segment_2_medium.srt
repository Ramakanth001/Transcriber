1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
 Because the Egya Veda becomes dirty after some time.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
 So new Egya Veda is to be put.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:18
 The Sadguru after preaching the disciples after some time, he will become dirty.

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
 Because of the dirt of the disciples, he will become dirty.

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
 So the Sadguru must be changed.

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:36
 He must be changed because of our dirt, he will become dirty.

7
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
 Otherwise he is pure.

8
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
 This happened to the temples.

9
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
 This happened to deities of temples.

10
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
 Deities of temples have become...

11
00:00:52 --> 00:01:16

157
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
 Everything is sweet.

158
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
 He has a sugar problem.

159
00:20:28 --> 00:20:39
 That is why Vidura gave him the outer skin of the banana fruit and threw the fruit.

160
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
 Because fruit contains sugar.

161
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
 In that outer leather, it contains vitamins and minerals.

162
00:20:46 --> 00:20:52
 And he, you know, after coming to Vidura's house, straightly he went to war.

163
00:20:52 --> 00:20:58
 In war, when arrows come, especially in Bhishma, through lot of arrows are Krishna.

164
00:20:58 --> 00:21:00
 Krishna was injured by it.

165
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
 So if he is sugar, since he has sugar, bleeding will not stop.

166
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
 If sugar is there, bleeding will not stop.

167
00:21:11 --> 00:21:17
 That is why thinking all this in future, very near future, Vidura gave him the banana leather

168
00:21:17 --> 00:21:19
 and threw the fruit.

169
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
 Because sugar will increase, then in the war arrow will come, then bleeding will not stop.

170
00:21:25 --> 00:21:31
 So he threw the fruit out and gave the leather of the banana fruit.

171
00:21:31 --> 00:21:35
 Because everything is sweet.

172
00:21:35 --> 00:21:51
 So I have, from the Krishna avatar, I have also imbibed one quality, that is sugar.

173
00:21:55 --> 00:21:59
 In that one quality, I am similar to Krishna.

174
00:22:05 --> 00:22:07
 That is wonderful, right?

175
00:22:07 --> 00:22:09
 Yes.

184
00:25:08 --> 00:25:10
 I stood there

185
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
 I wetted

186
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15

189
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
 I wetted

190
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
 I wetted

191
00:25:23 --> 00:25:25
 I wetted

192
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
 She told, I have seen this for 40 days.

193
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
 I want to get a job for my son.

194
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
 That is why I said.

195
00:25:43 --> 00:25:51
 I told her, even though you have a desire, your devotion is in your desire,

196
00:25:51 --> 00:25:53
 but you are singing, move my heart.

197
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
 My heart is blighted.

198
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
 I wept.

199
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
 I told her, definitely Krishna will bless you.

200
00:26:03 --> 00:26:07
 Next day, again and again I gave.

201
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
 No bhajan.

202
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
 Then I went inside and laughed.

203
00:26:12 --> 00:26:14
 I went inside and laughed.

204
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
 I went inside and laughed.

205
00:26:16 --> 00:26:18
 I went inside and laughed.

206
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
 Krishna really blessed.

207
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
 Krishna really blessed.

208
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
 Krishna really blessed.

209
00:26:24 --> 00:26:26
 Krishna really blessed.

210
00:26:26 --> 00:26:28
 Because he was moved.

211
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
 Because he was moved by the desire.

212
00:26:30 --> 00:26:34
 I told her, even though your devotion is with a desire,

213
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
 but Krishna is moved with your song,

214
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
 he has came for the lines.

215
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
 That is why he will be blessed.

216
00:26:41 --> 00:26:43
 Maybe there, maybe there.

217
00:26:43 --> 00:26:45
 But in that case, it is very easy.

218
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
 That is bhajan.

231
00:28:20 --> 00:28:22

 It is like,

236
00:28:30 --> 00:28:32
 there is a story.

237
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
 A big scholar went to a king.

238
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 The king was very much pleased

239
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
 with his scholarly knowledge.

240
00:28:39 --> 00:28:41
 With his scholarlyness and all that.

241
00:28:41 --> 00:28:43
 Poetry and scholarlyness.

242
00:28:43 --> 00:28:45
 He was very much pleased.

243
00:28:45 --> 00:28:47
 The king asked,

244
00:28:47 --> 00:28:49
 what do you want?

245
00:28:49 --> 00:28:51
 I want to give a gift.

246
00:28:51 --> 00:28:53
 The scholar told,

247
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
 today morning,

248
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
 my towel for taking bath,

249
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
 that rat spoiled that towel.

250
00:28:59 --> 00:29:01
 I want one towel.

251
00:29:09 --> 00:29:11
 The king wanted to give

252
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
 golden necklace, diamond,

253
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
 golden ornaments,

254
00:29:15 --> 00:29:17
 diamonds.

255
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
 Lot of wealth he wanted to give.

256
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
 He was so much impressed.

257
00:29:21 --> 00:29:23
 And the scholar asked,

258
00:29:23 --> 00:29:25
 one towel.

259
00:29:25 --> 00:29:27
 It is a problem for taking bath.

260
00:29:27 --> 00:29:29
 That rat has spoiled that towel.

261
00:29:29 --> 00:29:31
 It is a problem for taking bath.

262
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
 That rat has spoiled that towel.

263
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
 It is a problem for taking bath.

264
00:29:35 --> 00:29:37
 That rat has spoiled that towel.

265
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
 I am asking the third day,

266
00:29:40 --> 00:29:42
 Bhojanandeshya Rajendra.

267
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
 I tell a story also

268
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
 in this context.

269
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
 I think you all know.

270
00:29:58 --> 00:30:00
 One son came

271
00:30:00 --> 00:30:02
 and started to study.

272
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
 He was a very educated.

273
00:30:04 --> 00:30:06
 He studied a lot.
