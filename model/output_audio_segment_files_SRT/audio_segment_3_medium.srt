1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
 started pressing the feet of the father. He wanted 1000 rupees from the father for some

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
 luxury, some enjoyment, pity enjoyment, like cinema or something, something like that.

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:19
 For one hour he continuously pressed. The father was so much pleased, oh he is pressing

4
00:00:19 --> 00:00:28
 my feet with love, pure love, aspirationless love, with true love on me, he is pressing

5
00:00:28 --> 00:00:35
 the feet. Then he thought, the father thought, tomorrow I shall call the advocate. He is

6
00:00:35 --> 00:00:43
 the owner of property of several crores. All my property I shall write a will with the

7
00:00:43 --> 00:00:50
 help of that advocate. All my property I shall give that property to the son. Tomorrow I

8
00:00:50 --> 00:00:57
 shall call the advocate. That he was thinking. Then the son told, father, if you are pleased

9
00:00:57 --> 00:01:11
 with my service, I want 1000 rupees. For what purpose he asked? For some, going some pleasure.

10
00:01:11 --> 00:01:17
 He told, the pleasures are not good for health. So I am not giving that 1000 rupees. That

11
00:01:18 --> 00:01:32
 And also this will also, he lost the idea. He is not prepared to write the will. How

12
00:01:32 --> 00:01:41
 that desire spoils the entire thing, just like a drop of poison spoils the milk of the

13
00:01:41 --> 00:01:57
 whole big pot of milk. Poison drop mixed with the milk, the whole milk has become poison.

14
00:01:57 --> 00:02:06
 You cannot separate the milk from poison. It is mere milk. Same milk, mere milk, if

15
00:02:06 --> 00:02:15
 it is mixed with sugar, it will be far far better. So mere milk is better than poisoned

16
00:02:15 --> 00:02:28
 milk and sugar milk is better than mere milk. Is it not? So worldly desire mixed with devotion

17
00:02:28 --> 00:02:42
 is like poisoned milk. Simply desire is like mere milk. But desire mixed with, for God,

18
00:02:42 --> 00:02:50
 that is sugar milk. Sugar milk is better than milk and milk is better than poisoned milk.

19
00:02:50 --> 00:03:11
 I gave that simile in the morning answer. The karma, abhyasa and karma and jnana sahitha

20
00:03:11 --> 00:03:21
 karma. The abhyasa means the practice or action mixed with ignorance. You are blindly

21
00:03:21 --> 00:03:27
 doing a practice. You don't have knowledge of that practice. You don't have the aim of

22
00:03:27 --> 00:03:35
 that practice. That aim of the practice is only to have some pleasures, worldly pleasures.

23
00:03:35 --> 00:03:47
 That is doing ignorance. Doing ignorance to go to heaven. There also you are doing that

24
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
 ignorance not properly. Everything is twisted, everything is misinterpreted way. You are

25
00:03:53 --> 00:04:02
 doing that ignorance. Burning the ghee in the fire. So that is abhyasa. Abhyasa means

26
00:04:02 --> 00:04:17
 jnana sahitha karma. Practice action mixed with ignorance. Then mere karma is better

27
00:04:17 --> 00:04:27
 than that abhyasa. And jnana sahitha karma, the action mixed with knowledge is better

28
00:04:27 --> 00:04:38
 than mere karma. Jnatva kurvita karma. Sugar milk, like sugar milk.

29
00:04:38 --> 00:04:46
 What is the example for ignorance mixed action and pure action?

30
00:04:46 --> 00:04:57
 Ignorance mixed action. See, yajna is to be done. Yajna means cooking food with ghee,

31
00:04:57 --> 00:05:10
 and worshipping the Sadguru and other devotees. Giving this ghee fried food to sacrifice this

32
00:05:10 --> 00:05:20
 ghee fried food in the hunger fire, Vaishvanaragi of the Sadguru. That is jnana sahitha karma,

33
00:05:20 --> 00:05:40
 just mixed with sugar. So here poisoned milk is doing the same ignorance in a spoiled way,

34
00:05:40 --> 00:05:50
 in a misinterpreted way. Fire means hunger fire in the actual jnana sahitha karma. But

35
00:05:50 --> 00:06:00
 here they take physical fire as the agni. And they take the ghee fried food. Ghee fried

36
00:06:00 --> 00:06:14
 food is called as ghee. Doctor says, don't take much oil. Means oily food, avoid oily food. I don't drink oil.

37
00:06:14 --> 00:06:28
 Oil means oily food. So here they took oil, the ghee as ghee. Ghee is not ghee. Ghee is ghee fried food.

38
00:06:28 --> 00:06:37
 The possessor of an item is called by the name of the item. Suppose a seller of apples is going,

39
00:06:37 --> 00:06:45
 oh apples come. You are calling apples. Apples means seller of apples is called by the name of

40
00:06:45 --> 00:06:52
 the item, possessor by the, possessor. Possessor is called by the name of the possessor item.

41
00:06:54 --> 00:07:05
 That is lakshanartha. That is called as lakshanartha. So here they have taken the physical fire is used

42
00:07:05 --> 00:07:13
 to cook the food. And after cooking the food, that food is to be burnt in the hunger fire

43
00:07:14 --> 00:07:24
 of the hungry people, hungry guests. They have taken hunger fire, the possessor of the hunger fire

44
00:07:24 --> 00:07:31
 is also called as hunger fire. In Vedas it is when, who is that?

45
00:07:42 --> 00:07:51
 When Naciketa goes to Yama's house, for three days he was not supplied with food. He fasted for three days.

46
00:07:54 --> 00:08:01
 Madhguruhay, he has fasted for the last three nights. That is what Yama says to Naciketa.

47
00:08:02 --> 00:08:13
 Then Naciketa is told, Vaishvanara Pravesh, Brahmano gruham. This Naciketa is the Vaishvanara fire.

48
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
 Possessor of Vaishvanara fire is called by the name of Vaishvanara fire.

49
00:08:20 --> 00:08:27
 Possessor of apples is called as apples. Possessor of Vaishvanara fire is also called as Vaishvanara fire.

50
00:08:28 --> 00:08:42
 That is fire. So you must supply ghee to the fire. That is the sentence. Here in the literal sense,

51
00:08:42 --> 00:08:48
 you must supply the ghee to the physical fire. That is the vachyatha, literal sense.

52
00:08:48 --> 00:08:56
 But implied sense is, ghee means food possessed, possessing ghee is called as ghee.

53
00:08:57 --> 00:09:05
 Possessor of apples is called as apples. Similarly, fire means possessing the hunger fire is called as fire.

54
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
 It is not physical fire. It is hunger fire. Here it is not ghee. It is food possessed with the ghee.

55
00:09:13 --> 00:09:22
 So you supply the food possessed with the ghee to a hungry person, hungry guest, to that fire.

56
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
 He is having a hunger fire. So he is fire. So these people, what they thought?

57
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
 Instead of taking implied sense, they have taken the literal sense.

58
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
 He means fire. Fire means that fire. Put the ghee in that fire. Burn it.

59
00:09:40 --> 00:09:48
 That is called as abhyasa. Abhyasa means tradition. My father did like that. My grandfather did like that.

60
00:09:48 --> 00:09:55
 My grand grandfather did like this. So let me do. That is called the abhyasa, blind tradition.

61
00:09:56 --> 00:10:01
 In which the action is mixed with ignorance.

62
00:10:03 --> 00:10:08
 Because the fire is understood as hungry person, nor ghee is understood as food possessing ghee.

63
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
 That is ignorance only. Not knowing the implied sense is agnana only.

64
00:10:17 --> 00:10:23
 Lachchanartha, agnana, agnana. Not knowing the Lachchanartha implied sense is ignorance.

65
00:10:24 --> 00:10:29
 So the performance of yajna, sacrifice is with ignorance.

66
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
 Then this misinterpretation is the positive.

67
00:10:38 --> 00:10:47
 Same yajna, that is same milk, mere karma. That is mere milk. When it is mixed with sugar,

68
00:10:47 --> 00:10:57
 the fire is taken as the person possessing hunger fire. The ghee is taken as the food possessing ghee.

69
00:10:57 --> 00:11:07
 And it is supplied to the fire. Fire means hunger fire. Hunger fire means the possession of the hunger fire.

70
00:11:08 --> 00:11:20
 Here the Rukyada mantra says that the fire is burning the food and is also supplying the food.

71
00:11:22 --> 00:11:31
 Agrim hotaram. Two words he has given. Agri. Agri means fire. Receiving the food, receiving the ghee.

72
00:11:31 --> 00:11:41
 That is ghee food. And he is also the same Agri. He is supplying the food, this ghee. How it can supply it? It is inert.

73
00:11:43 --> 00:11:51
 Human being priest is supplying the ghee to the fire. But the fire is said to be the supplier of food also.

74
00:11:51 --> 00:11:59
 Not only Havaniyya, inert fire, but also the Hota, supplier of the ghee. How the inert fire can become?

75
00:12:01 --> 00:12:11
 Supplier as well as receiver. That applies when the hungry person is eating the food.

76
00:12:11 --> 00:12:21
 He is supplying the food, he is Hota, and that is burnt in the hunger fire. It is how many it is also receiver?

77
00:12:21 --> 00:12:43
 So the Yajna is milk, mere milk. With bad interpretation it is poisoned milk. With good interpretation it is sugar mixed milk.

78
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
 Swami here mere milk means how to do that Yajna? Is it feeding people or is it pouring ghee?

79
00:12:49 --> 00:12:57
 Everything karma, action. Practice. Practical thing, action. Mere action.

80
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
 Then this also, Abhyasa also mere action.

81
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
 Abhyasa is not mere action. With twisted meaning, with wrong meaning it is interpreted.

82
00:13:05 --> 00:13:13
 The fire is taken as the physical fire, receiver. Ghee is taken as the, ghee fried food is taken as ghee.

83
00:13:13 --> 00:13:21
 And putting the ghee in the physical fire, burning the ghee in the physical fire is the poison.

84
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
 This is misinterpreted meaning is the poison.

85
00:13:25 --> 00:13:35
 The same action, same sacrifice, mixed with misinterpreted poisonous interpretation is Abhyasa.

86
00:13:35 --> 00:13:41
 That is done by poor of Imam's class. And Shankara condemned that.

87
00:13:41 --> 00:13:51
 Shankara condemned the poisoned milk. So what they thought, Shankara condemned both milk and poison.

88
00:13:51 --> 00:13:57
 Shankara condemned only poison. But he condemned, he has to condemn the poisoned milk.

89
00:13:57 --> 00:14:03
 Because the poison is mixed with milk. Poison cannot be isolated from milk.

90
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
 He did not condemn the milk. He condemned only the poison.

91
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
 So he condemned Agnana but he did not condemn Karma.

92
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
 He did not condemn Karma.

93
00:14:15 --> 00:14:25
 If he has condemned Karma, why he appreciated the Kumarila Bhatta who is Gnana Karma Samucheyavada,

94
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
 that is the milk mixed with sugar is appreciated by Shankara.

95
00:14:31 --> 00:14:39
 That means he is not rejecting mere milk. He is rejecting only the poison.

96
00:14:39 --> 00:14:45
 But since poison cannot be isolated from that milk, that poisoned milk, he rejected.

97
00:14:45 --> 00:14:53
 This poisoned milk should be rejected. He is not against the milk. He is against the poison only.

98
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
 Wonderful Sona.

99
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
 Again there is poison milk. So Shankara has again come back.

100
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
 That is what I mean. It is a simile.

101
00:15:11 --> 00:15:23
 Swami, have a doubt. My doubt is that you have done Yashwamedha Yagam in Ramayanam.

102
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
 I did not understand. Now Krishna has come with Krishna and asked him to do Yashwamedha Yagam.

103
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
 In Ramayanam there are many different shlokas.

104
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
 That means inserted shlokas by others.

105
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
 Many shlokas have been inserted.

106
00:15:41 --> 00:15:47
 In Smritu, in History, how to do that Yashwamedha Yagam.

107
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
 They have inserted.

108
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
 What they have done is, they have removed some shlokas and

109
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
 they have done Yashwamedha Yagam.

110
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
 So, they have done Yashwamedha Yagam.

111
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
 This is not a sin.

112
00:16:03 --> 00:16:09
 Now, you have to get angry with the people who are against the religion of Hinduism.

113
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
 They have to get angry with the people who are against the religion of Hinduism.

114
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
 They have to spoil the religion of Hinduism.

115
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
 They have inserted these shlokas to spoil it.

116
00:16:17 --> 00:16:21
 Yashwamedha means senses.

117
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
 To make these senses pure is Yashwamedha.

118
00:16:25 --> 00:16:35
 What they do for that is, they make a dog with the flour and cut it with a knife.

119
00:16:35 --> 00:16:47
 The dog made with the flour is a representative model for the senses.

120
00:16:47 --> 00:16:57
 To control these senses, they have done a psychological model on the representative model.

121
00:16:57 --> 00:17:03
 To get the psychological inspiration, they use the knife to cut the dog.

122
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
 The dog with the flour.

123
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
 Not to cut the dog's throat.

124
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
 To get the inspiration.

125
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
 To control the senses.

126
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
 This is not a sin.

127
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
 This is not a sin.

128
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
 This is not a sin.

129
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
 This is not a sin.

130
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
 This is not a sin.

131
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
 This is not a sin.

132
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
 This is not a sin.

133
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
 This is not a sin.

134
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
 This is not a sin.

135
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
 This is not a sin.

136
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
 This is not a sin.

137
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
 This is not a sin.

138
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
 This is not a sin.

139
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
 This is not a sin.

140
00:17:41 --> 00:17:53
 When our minds think of food, lunch or dinner,

141
00:19:53 --> 00:19:54

 that.

322
00:27:13 --> 00:27:18
 Yes Swami. Thank you Swami.

323
00:27:18 --> 00:27:25
 In Buddhism, Buddha taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

324
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
 Yes, Buddha is the one who taught us.

325
00:27:29 --> 00:27:35
 Ramo Ramasya Budhasya Buddha Kalikirevaja

326
00:27:35 --> 00:27:39
 Ramo Ramasya Krishnasya Buddha Kalikirevaja

327
00:27:39 --> 00:27:42
 Buddha taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

328
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
 Buddha taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

329
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
 Is it the same as our Krishna taught us?

330
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
 Where is the Buddha?

331
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
 If you say that Hindu taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma,

332
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
 then our Lord Krishna is the one who taught us.

333
00:28:24 --> 00:28:27
 All the other Gopas are devotees.

334
00:28:30 --> 00:28:32
 They are hungry.

335
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
 They can't eat.

336
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 He practically showed us the knowledge.

337
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40
 To spoil the knowledge is like spoiling the Gopis.

338
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
 He spoilt the knowledge too.

339
00:28:48 --> 00:28:51
 He gave a fight to the Gopis like he gave a victory to the Gopis.

340
00:28:52 --> 00:28:57
 He gave a fight to the Gopis by testing them with the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

341
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
 I said it as a joke.

342
00:28:59 --> 00:29:01
 They said it as a joke.

343
00:29:01 --> 00:29:03
 But he really did it.

344
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
 He tested them with the knowledge of Vedic Dharma and gave them a fight.

345
00:29:05 --> 00:29:10
 He gave a fight to the people who gave the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

346
00:29:14 --> 00:29:17
 So, the Buddha taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

347
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
 Why did Buddha teach us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma?

348
00:29:21 --> 00:29:23
 We are not even talking about Hinduism.

349
00:29:23 --> 00:29:27
 Why did Buddha teach us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma?

350
00:29:27 --> 00:29:29
 Yes, Swami.

351
00:29:29 --> 00:29:31
 Thank you, Swami.

352
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
 Thank you, Swami.

353
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
 Okay.

354
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
 Even the Gopis who were taught by Lord Krishna when they were young,

355
00:29:41 --> 00:29:43
 they were taken care of by the people.

356
00:29:43 --> 00:29:47
 Yes, but they have names like Lalitha, Swati, Vishaka.

357
00:29:47 --> 00:29:49
 Vishaka.

358
00:29:49 --> 00:29:51
 They were raised by Lord Krishna.

359
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
 They were raised by Lord Krishna.

360
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
 Yes, Krishna was raised by Lord Krishna.

361
00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
 He was also of age.
