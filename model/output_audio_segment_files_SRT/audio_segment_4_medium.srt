1
00:01:30 --> 00:01:31
 So, the language is very strong.

2
00:01:31 --> 00:01:32
 The language is very strong.

3
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33

00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
 The language is very strong.

10
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
 The language is very strong.

11
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
 The language is very strong.

12
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
 The language is very strong.

13
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
 The language is very strong.

14
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
 The language is very strong.

15
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
 The language is very strong.

16
00:01:45 --> 00:01:46
 The language is very strong.

17
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
 The language is very strong.

18
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
 The language is very strong.

19
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
 The language is very strong.

20
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
 The language is very strong.

21
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
 The language is very strong.

22
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
 The language is very strong.

23
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
 The language is very strong.

24
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
 The language is very strong.

25
00:01:54 --> 00:01:55
 The language is very strong.

26
00:01:55 --> 00:01:56
 The language is very strong.

27
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
 The language is very strong.

28
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
 The language is very strong.

29
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
 The language is very strong.

30
00:02:00 --> 00:02:01
 The language is very strong.

31
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
 The language is very strong.

32
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
 The language is very strong.

33
00:02:03 --> 00:02:04
 The language is very strong.

34
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
 The language is very strong.

35
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
 The language is very strong.

36
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
 The language is very strong.

37
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
 The language is very strong.

38
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
 The language is very strong.

39
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
 The language is very strong.

40
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
 The language is very strong.

41
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
 The language is very strong.

42
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
 The language is very strong.

43
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
 The language is very strong.

44
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
 The language is very strong.

45
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
 The language is very strong.

46
00:02:16 --> 00:02:17
 The language is very strong.

47
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
 The language is very strong.

48
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
 The language is very strong.

49
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
 The language is very strong.

50
00:02:20 --> 00:02:21
 The language is very strong.

51
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
 The language is very strong.

52
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
 The language is very strong.

53
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
 The language is very strong.

54
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
 The language is very strong.

55
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
 The language is very strong.

56
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
 Did she do it?

57
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
 Did she do it?

58
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
 Yes.

59
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
 Yes.

60
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
 Two tests are All right

61
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
 Yes.

62
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
 ë§¹ Yes.

63
00:02:34 --> 00:02:35
 We It's called Govinda.

64
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
 Govinda test.

65
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
 And now we have gotten exam result.

66
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
 Now we have got exam result.

67
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
 Let's give a group test for each A.

68
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
 What will be the average score for trump card,

69
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
 Venus,

70
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
 And it's a good result.

71
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
 But the two tests are all right.

72
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
 So are

73
00:03:51 --> 00:03:58
 How he touched others' lives.

74
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
 Donation pariksha.

75
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
 They actually fail.

76
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
 See, everybody will raise objection when all the candidates fail in their test.

77
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
 Then people with some questions must be tough or out of syllabus.

78
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
 But he did not raise that failed test, objection to the failed test.

79
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
 The test in which all pass, to that he is raising objection.

80
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
 Pariksha.

81
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
 Why he passed?

82
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
 Passed, all passed.

83
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
 First class.

84
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
 First class, distinct class.

85
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
 Not, 100 out of 100.

86
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
 You got it right.

87
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
 But he is asking why, why he has asked.

88
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
 Because he is also a soul.

89
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
 He knows the easiness of this test, difficulty of this.

90
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
 Suppose he is asked to face the putreshana and dhanesha test.

91
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
 He also failed.

92
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
 That is why he kept silent.

93
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
 Every soul will fail.

94
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
 That is not the right answer.

95
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
 This everybody will pass.

96
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
 There he attacked.

97
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
 So he wanted to be over smart.

98
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
 Yes, over smart.

99
00:05:01 --> 00:05:06
 So that is the very pariksha question itself is meaningless.

100
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
 He should have raised the failed test.

101
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
 See, in this all failed.

102
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
 Question paper must be tough.

103
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
 Question paper must contain very difficult questions.

104
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
 Or out of syllabus questions.

105
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
 Like that he should raise the failed test.

106
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
 But he raised the objection about the pass test.

107
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
 In which every candidate got 100 out of 100.

108
00:05:27 --> 00:05:31
 He raised the subjection on that.

109
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
 So his question itself is meaningless.

110
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
 You gave a wonderful example of examiner and a doctor doing delivery.

111
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
 Yes, yes.

112
00:05:43 --> 00:05:44
 He did it.

113
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
 See, who ran for the examination?

114
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
 The teacher did not run.

115
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
 Examiner did not.

116
00:05:50 --> 00:05:57
 Students in the Amavatha or Incarnation Rama, they went and asked you to test that dhanesha.

117
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
 They did not ask for dhanesha and putreshana.

118
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
 Because they thought, that is very easy test.

119
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
 Everybody will pass.

120
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
 That is very difficult test.

121
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
 But all failed in dhanesha and putreshana only.

122
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
 These judges thought that is very difficult test.

123
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
 You please test.

124
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
 No, no, no, that is very easy test.

125
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
 Everybody will pass.

126
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
 Be born as a real good guy.

127
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
 Then I will put all the three tests.

128
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
 Final examination.

129
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
 Final examination contains four syllabus.

130
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
 Tangible examination.

131
00:06:31 --> 00:06:32
 Quarterly examination syllabus.

132
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
 Half year examination syllabus.

133
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
 Plus third term.

134
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
 Total three strongest ones.

135
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
 Yes, testing.

136
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
 Correct.

137
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
 So there he is the examiner.

138
00:06:45 --> 00:06:51
 He is not seeker of knowledge.

139
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
 He is asking questions to you for the correct answers.

140
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
 You are thinking that he does not know the answer.

141
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
 And he is asking you.

142
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
 He wants to learn from you.

143
00:07:01 --> 00:07:08
 As examiner, he is concentrating only on the examination.

144
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
 Examination system.

145
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
 Pass or fail.

146
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
 Only he is concentrating on that.

147
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
 Not on this romance.

148
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
 For that I gave that example of doctor in olden days.

149
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
 Male doctors, female doctors were not there.

150
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
 Sometime back.

151
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
 When a female undergoes delivery has to give birth to a child.

152
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
 Male doctors used to do the delivery.

153
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
 Sometime back.

154
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
 Some generations.

155
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
 That his concentration is only on the delivery of the child.

156
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
 Without any harm to the mother and the child.

157
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
 The child should come out.

158
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
 And so that they will pay the fees.

159
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
 Also they will respect.

160
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
 They will thank him.

161
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
 That is his concentration.

162
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
 As examiner he is testing the Dhaneshana, Sushreshana and Dhaneshana.

163
00:08:02 --> 00:08:08
 When he is delivering the child, you think you are touching the private parts of that lady.

164
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
 So you have some romantic feeling.

165
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
 It is a diversion.

166
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
 He is not.

167
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
 If he is concentrating on that and the delivery fails.

168
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
 Then he will be scolded.

169
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
 He will be beaten.

170
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
 He will not be given fees.

171
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
 So Krishna's concentration is on the test.

172
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
 Not for romance.

173
00:08:31 --> 00:08:36
 If he wants romance, the heaven angels will come in queue.

174
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
 He can create the most unimaginable, beautiful lady.

175
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
 He himself can create.

176
00:08:44 --> 00:08:51
 Narayana, when he made a line on his lap.

177
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
 Like this.

178
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
 Uruvasi came from there.

179
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
 Uru.

180
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
 Uru means lap.

181
00:08:58 --> 00:09:03
 From the lap, Uruvasi was born.

182
00:09:03 --> 00:09:08
 So does he want romance?

183
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
 And he was lying on milk ocean.

184
00:09:12 --> 00:09:20
 Does he steal milk?

185
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
 He was having only the examiner attitude.

186
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
 Because in Ramavatar they pressured him like anything.

187
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
 That is why as soon as he was born, he conducted those tests.

188
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
 That is the primary work of his incarnation.

189
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
 Tapasamsthaapana is everywhere.

190
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
 In every avatar it is done.

191
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
 Macha avatar, Kuma, Narasimha avatar.

192
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
 Everywhere it is done.

193
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
 This is a very special case.

194
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
 Very delicate thing.

195
00:09:48 --> 00:09:53
 Since he conducted that examination, gave the results correctly.

196
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
 That is why he is called as Paripurna avatar.

197
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
 Very difficult to understand.

198
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
 Otherwise the god will be blamed.

199
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
 There is every possibility of blaming the god.

200
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
 That he conducted very correctly.

201
00:10:11 --> 00:10:16
 And before conducting that test, he also showed several miracles.

202
00:10:16 --> 00:10:21
 Telling that I am god, don't imitate.

203
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
 Nobody shall imitate.

204
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
 He lifted the Govardhana mountain with his finger.

205
00:10:28 --> 00:10:37
 So that is why when I wrote gopik, I told them to put Krishna with mountain on this finger.

206
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
 So that if anybody comes, I am Krishna.

207
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
 Lift the mountain.

208
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
 Then they will say, Adyatriya.

209
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
 Very beautiful.

210
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
 I will come later on.

211
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
 Not Adyatriya.

212
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
 There also you are showing the other.

213
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
 So all the meaning is foolishness.

214
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
 That is why Narayani Bhakshasutra's wrote,

215
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
 Na Tatrapi.

216
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
 All gopikas know that he is god.

217
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
 That is why they danced with him.

218
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
 They don't have ignorance.

219
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
 They know that he is god.

220
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
 That is why they danced with him.

221
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
 Next sutra.

222
00:11:40 --> 00:11:50
 If that recognition of god about Krishna is not there in gopikas, then they will go to hell.

223
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
 That is the sin.

224
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
 They must go to hell.

225
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
 Krishna will not go to hell.

226
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
 Because he is only examining.

227
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
 You cannot say Krishna should go to hell.

228
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
 Actually both should go to hell.

229
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
 In the case of human being.

230
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
 Violating the rule.

231
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
 He is not doing with that view.

232
00:12:13 --> 00:12:26
 If these people, if these gopikas did dance with him with that view, with sinful view, with lust, hormonal provoked lust.

233
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
 Then Tadjihira Jaraana Vivaad. They will go to hell.

234
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
 That is not their attitude.

235
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
 Because intention is devotion.

236
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
 Intention is not lust.

237
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
 Why lust will be there? They are sages.

238
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
 Even heavenly dancers when they came, they cursed them.

239
00:12:47 --> 00:12:53
 Their penance was not disturbed by Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka, Kilotama.

240
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
 They cursed them.

241
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
 They won.

242
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
 They burned their lust in penance fire.

243
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
 How they can have lust?

244
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
 They have devotion.

245
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
 Only due to devotion they danced with him.

246
00:13:09 --> 00:13:14
 So when intention, intention only brings the result to action.

247
00:13:14 --> 00:13:22
 Suppose a father hugs his own daughter and kisses daughter due to his love on the issue.

248
00:13:22 --> 00:13:29
 And same lady, suppose a rapist rowdy comes and hugs and kisses her.

249
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
 Same action in both cases?

250
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
 Accuracy.

251
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
 But here father is appreciated for his love to say yield.

252
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
 There he goes to hell.

253
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
 Even the government courts they will punish him.

254
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
 Even here as well as there he will be punished.

255
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
 But same action.

256
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
 Why this difference in the result of good?

257
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
 Because intention is different.

258
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
 So their intention is not lust because they are sages.

259
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
 They have already burned their lust in the penance fire.

260
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
 Their intention is only devotion to God.

261
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
 Just like the father hugging his own issue.

262
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
 Like that devotion only.

263
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
 Like that.

264
00:14:19 --> 00:14:25
 Those two sutras are meant for this.

265
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
 Jara vacha.

266
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
 How you should love God?

267
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
 What intensity of love you should be after God?

268
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
 Then he searches for an example in the whole world.

269
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
 What example he got in Narada Sages?

270
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
 In Narada?

271
00:14:49 --> 00:14:57
 A lady having illegal relationship with somebody.

272
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
 How much she loves that illegal fellow?

273
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
 Such love you should love God.

274
00:15:05 --> 00:15:10
 See intensity, no better example he found.

275
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
 One day one fellow came to my father.

276
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
 My father is an astrologer.

277
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
 Very famous in anthropology.

278
00:15:17 --> 00:15:25
 He told my father, sir, your name is increasing, your fame is increasing like sin.

279
00:15:27 --> 00:15:32
 His intention is not to appreciate only my father.

280
00:15:32 --> 00:15:39
 As sin is increasing very fastly, your fame is increasing.

281
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
 So even though it is a bad example, but in the intensity that is the highest example.

282
00:15:45 --> 00:15:52
 Whenever a simile is given, you need not touch the simile in all aspects.

283
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
 Your face is like moon.

284
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
 Face is like moon only in one aspect.

285
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
 Your face is present as the moon.

286
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
 Not in all other aspects.

287
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
 Moon has black dots.

288
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
 Your face is black.

289
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
 Moon grows in the Shukla Patsha.

290
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
 In Amavasya it disappears.

291
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
 Your face doesn't grow.

292
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
 Moon is eclipsed by Rahu and Tethu.

293
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
 Your face is not eclipsed by Rahu and Tethu.

294
00:16:22 --> 00:16:28
 Only one quality simile is taken that is called as Ekabhagopama.

295
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
 Ekabhagopama, only one aspect.

296
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
 That is the intensity.

297
00:16:34 --> 00:16:39
 The intensity of love there is the highest.

298
00:16:39 --> 00:16:43
 Only for that intensity point he has given the example.

299
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
 Because it is Ekabhagopama.

300
00:16:45 --> 00:16:50
 It did not have other properties or similars in other properties.

301
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
 That is Purnopama.

302
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
 This is Ekabhagopama.

303
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
 And for that I give a story also.

304
00:16:59 --> 00:17:06
 King Bhoja came in disguise to see how the people are living in his kingdom.

305
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11
 He sat on the Arugantara Baita.

306
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
 There he sat.

307
00:17:14 --> 00:17:22
 That lady, that family lady, a crow came and sounded ka ka like that.

308
00:17:22 --> 00:17:27
 The lady was afraid and ran into the house.

309
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
 What is this?

310
00:17:29 --> 00:17:34
 For crow sound she feared and ran into the house.

311
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
 Something must be there.

312
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
 Let me observe what happens.

313
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
 He slept in the night outside the house.

314
00:17:42 --> 00:17:49
 Then in the midnight she made her husband to sleep.

315
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
 Took Laja.

316
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
 Laja means Murmuru.

317
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
 Two puffed rice.

318
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
 Two hands.

319
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
 And she left the house in the midnight.

320
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
 Went to Narmada river.

321
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
 She crossed the Narmada river.

322
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
 In Narmada the crocodiles are more.

323
00:18:13 --> 00:18:19
 So she puts one handful Murmuru.

324
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
 The crocodiles will go to catch those.

325
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
 Then she will cross.

326
00:18:24 --> 00:18:29
 Then she spent the time with her illegal relationship.

327
00:18:29 --> 00:18:34
 And returning back the second handful rice to cross the Narmada river.

328
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
 Per crocodiles.

329
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
 This is Bhujah.

330
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
 Next day he came to the court.

331
00:18:40 --> 00:18:41
 Sabha.

332
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
 Then he gave a tamasya.

333
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
 Tamasya means

334
00:18:47 --> 00:18:56
 A lady was frightened with the sound of crow in the daytime.

335
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
 He gave the tamasya.

336
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
 First line.

337
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
 Nobody could understand this.

338
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
 Only Kali Asa could understand.

339
00:19:05 --> 00:19:07
 Kali Asa is a student.

340
00:19:07 --> 00:19:10
 After Narmada river.

341
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
 She crossed the Narmada river in the night time.

342
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
 Then Bhujah told the third line.

343
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
 Atrasanti jale graha.

344
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
 But in Narmada river several crocodiles are present.

345
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
 Talaja saiva sundari.

346
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
 She has two.

347
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
 In the two both hands she has a pocket knife.

348
00:19:31 --> 00:19:41
 That is how he has taken that example for intensity.

349
00:19:41 --> 00:19:48
 Because there in illegal relationship there is obstruction.

350
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
 No it is not good.

351
00:19:49 --> 00:19:50
 You should not do.

352
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
 Then intensity will increase.

353
00:19:52 --> 00:19:54
 Somebody says it is not good.

354
00:19:54 --> 00:19:55
 Don't go there.

355
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
 Then I get the ingredients.

356
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
 Somebody says it is good.

357
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
 There is no anxiety.

358
00:20:03 --> 00:20:06
 That is human tendency.

359
00:20:06 --> 00:20:15
 So much background for bhakti.

360
00:20:15 --> 00:20:17
 Madhura bhakti.

361
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
 So much background.

362
00:20:19 --> 00:20:31
 And finally I found the females their eyes have gone to the top of the head.

363
00:20:31 --> 00:20:36
 And therefore Sravakya told you are a mad fellow.

364
00:20:36 --> 00:20:39
 Stole in the hand of mad fellow.

365
00:20:39 --> 00:20:42
 We don't know which side he will throw.

366
00:20:42 --> 00:20:45
 Then he will throw this stone to which side.

367
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
 One day you raise your madhura bhakti to sky.

368
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
 And now you blasted it completely.

369
00:20:52 --> 00:21:00
 I told you see by word, by mind that devotion is common to males and females.

370
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
 But they have this body cannot be surrendered to God because they are males.

371
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
 Then they feel that females have that facility.

372
00:21:10 --> 00:21:12
 They don't have that facility.

373
00:21:12 --> 00:21:19
 Then I told you compare Gopika's surrendering bodies to Krishna, God.

374
00:21:19 --> 00:21:26
 You compare monkeys surrendering their bodies in the war on behalf of Rama.

375
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
 Prepare for torture with the opposite weapons and prepare for death.

376
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
 The Gopika's surrendered bodies for getting some pleasure.

377
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
 Atmarastha kamaya sarvam priya bhagati.

378
00:21:38 --> 00:21:40
 That is already told.

379
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
 They got some pleasure from God.

380
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
 But here there is no pleasure.

381
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
 Death will come.

382
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
 And torture will come with the opposite weapons.

383
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
 So what are Gopika's before those monkeys?

384
00:21:56 --> 00:22:06
 I am directly told you are a mad fellow.

385
00:22:06 --> 00:22:13
 Your knowledge is like a stone present in the hand of a mad fellow.

386
00:22:13 --> 00:22:18
 You don't know to which direction he will throw, to which side he will throw.

387
00:22:18 --> 00:22:20
 Nobody knows.

388
00:22:20 --> 00:22:26
 One day you put the masarabhakti at the top most.

389
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
 That is Goloka.

390
00:22:28 --> 00:22:34
 Higher than Brahma Loka is given to Gopika.

391
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
 So higher than highest fruit.

392
00:22:37 --> 00:22:39
 Like that you raise it.

393
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
 I raise it as long as the eyes are in this area.

394
00:22:44 --> 00:22:52
 But when the eyes go there, I must bring it down the ice.

395
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
 Recent thing, recent knowledge.

396
00:22:58 --> 00:22:59
 Yes sir.

397
00:22:59 --> 00:23:00
 I got that.

398
00:23:00 --> 00:23:04
 Initially you said that madhura bhakti is very much misunderstood.

399
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
 That is why I raised.

400
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
 Because in initial stage it was misunderstood.

401
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
 It is one of the best ways.

402
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
 It is one of the best ways.

403
00:23:14 --> 00:23:17
 That does not mean other best ways are not present.

404
00:23:17 --> 00:23:22
 See gold medals from various departments are equal.

405
00:23:22 --> 00:23:27
 In history department you got gold medal, in politics department you got gold medal.

406
00:23:27 --> 00:23:29
 Both are equal.

407
00:23:29 --> 00:23:37
 So Brahma Loka, Goloka and Dattasevaka Loka, these three are equal.

408
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
 Gold medalist from different departments.

409
00:23:41 --> 00:24:03
 Like that Dattasevaka Loka is Arvajna.

410
00:24:03 --> 00:24:07
 Arvajna means she knows everything.

411
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
 She knows how to raise the ego and how to down the ego.

412
00:24:16 --> 00:24:19
 And that is always understood by everybody also.

413
00:24:19 --> 00:24:20
 Yes.

414
00:24:20 --> 00:24:27
 That is the fundamental characteristic of God Dattah.

415
00:24:27 --> 00:24:33
 God Dattah, prajnana ghanaha is called as embodiment of knowledge.

416
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
 Solidified knowledge.

417
00:24:36 --> 00:24:38
 Ghanah means solid.

418
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
 See you cannot see the gaseous state.

419
00:24:40 --> 00:24:44
 Liquid you can see but it is moving.

420
00:24:44 --> 00:24:51
 But solid, standard, static you can see very clearly for a long time.

421
00:24:51 --> 00:24:55
 So in solid state clarity is highest.

422
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
 Standard also.

423
00:24:58 --> 00:25:01
 That static in nature is always present.

424
00:25:01 --> 00:25:02
 It is always static.

425
00:25:02 --> 00:25:04
 It won't move.

426
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
 It is more clear than liquid.

427
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
 So he is called as prajnana ghanaha.

428
00:25:12 --> 00:25:14
 The knowledge is solidified.

429
00:25:14 --> 00:25:16
 He is God Dattah.

430
00:25:16 --> 00:25:23
 Solidified means in his knowledge everywhere clarity will be the maximum.

431
00:25:23 --> 00:25:30
 Without clarity what is the use of preaching?

432
00:25:30 --> 00:25:39
 See when there is no clarity in the knowledge that means the preacher himself has no clarity about the subject.

433
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
 He is confused.

434
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
 He is not having clear knowledge about the topic which he is preaching to others.

435
00:25:47 --> 00:25:53
 So like that clarity.

436
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
 So that is the way of the knowledge.

437
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
 What?

438
00:25:57 --> 00:25:59
 So that is the way of the knowledge.

439
00:25:59 --> 00:26:01
 So that is the way of the knowledge.

440
00:26:01 --> 00:26:03
 Not only that Swami.

441
00:26:03 --> 00:26:05
 Not only prajnana ghanaha.

442
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
 That is the way of the knowledge.

443
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
 That is the way of the knowledge.

444
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
 That is the way of the knowledge.

445
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
 That is the way of the knowledge.

446
00:26:13 --> 00:26:15
 That is the way of the knowledge.

447
00:26:15 --> 00:26:17
 That is the way of the knowledge.

448
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
 That is the way of the knowledge.

449
00:26:19 --> 00:26:21
 That is the way of the knowledge.

450
00:26:21 --> 00:26:23
 Omnipotent.

451
00:26:23 --> 00:26:25
 Actually one omnipotent is sufficient.

452
00:26:25 --> 00:26:27
 That adjective is sufficient.

453
00:26:27 --> 00:26:29
 Other things are not necessary.

454
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
 Omnipotent means omniscient.

455
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
 Omnipotent means without being omnipresent he is omniscient.

456
00:26:37 --> 00:26:39
 That is due to omnipotence.

457
00:26:39 --> 00:26:43
 So one adjective omnipotence is sufficient.

458
00:26:43 --> 00:26:48
 Omnipresent and omniscient are not necessary.

459
00:26:49 --> 00:26:53
 They are automatically resulting due to omnipotence.

460
00:26:56 --> 00:26:58
 So that one adjective is sufficient.

461
00:26:58 --> 00:27:00
 Sarva Shittimavana.

462
00:27:02 --> 00:27:09
 That is what the spiritual discussion between Ari Samajaya and Sanatana Dharma took place in Mahakumbhamela.

463
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
 Yes Swami.

464
00:27:11 --> 00:27:13
 There Karapatra Swami came.

465
00:27:13 --> 00:27:17
 And the debate is going on for some five days.

466
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
 Between Ari Samajaya and Sanatana Dharma.

467
00:27:22 --> 00:27:24
 I closed the debate in five minutes.

468
00:27:27 --> 00:27:30
 I just put one question to Ari Samajaya.

469
00:27:30 --> 00:27:32
 Swarats.

470
00:27:32 --> 00:27:34
 Ishwara Sarva Shittimavana?

471
00:27:34 --> 00:27:38
 Because Vala is taken in Sanskrit language.

472
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
 So I asked him.

473
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
 Is God omnipotent or not?

474
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
 They say omnipotent.

475
00:27:46 --> 00:27:47
 Ishwara Sarva Shittimavana.

476
00:27:47 --> 00:27:49
 Even Ari Samajaya Dayanath Saraswati says.

477
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
 Ishwara Sarva Shittimavana.

478
00:27:51 --> 00:27:53
 Then?

479
00:27:53 --> 00:27:56
 Is he, that means he possesses all powers.

480
00:27:56 --> 00:28:00
 Then is he possessing the power to incarnate or not?

481
00:28:05 --> 00:28:11
 He is possessing the power to incarnate.

482
00:28:11 --> 00:28:14
 Then there should be no objection for his incarnation.

483
00:28:14 --> 00:28:18
 If we say he is not, they are regressed incarnations.

484
00:28:18 --> 00:28:23
 If he says he is not having that power, then he cannot be omnipotent.

485
00:28:23 --> 00:28:27
 All powers present except that one power.

486
00:28:27 --> 00:28:29
 99 powers are present.

487
00:28:29 --> 00:28:30
 100 are not present.

488
00:28:30 --> 00:28:31
 One is less.

489
00:28:31 --> 00:28:33
 Then how he can be omnipotent?

490
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
 Then he told.

491
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
 No, no, he is omnipotent.

492
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
 But he is not taking the incarnation.

493
00:28:46 --> 00:28:49
 Not unable to take the incarnation.

494
00:28:49 --> 00:28:52
 But he does not want to take incarnation.

495
00:28:52 --> 00:28:54
 Like that she said.

496
00:28:54 --> 00:28:56
 Then I told.

497
00:28:56 --> 00:28:58
 The devotees are praying for the incarnation.

498
00:28:58 --> 00:29:04
 They want to have Sambhashana, Darshan, Darshan, Sambhashana, Sahavata.

499
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
 They are praying.

500
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
 And God is very kind.

501
00:29:08 --> 00:29:10
 Devotees are praying for that.

502
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
 Why you are standing in between God and the devotees?

503
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
 Like Andhika Narbhavati.

504
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
 He has the power to incarnate.

505
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
 They are praying him to incarnate.

506
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
 They want to see him.

507
00:29:30 --> 00:29:32
 They want to talk with him.

508
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36
 They want to touch him by doing Pada Namaskaram.

509
00:29:36 --> 00:29:38
 They want to live with him.

510
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
 They are praying.

511
00:29:40 --> 00:29:42
 And he has that power.

512
00:29:42 --> 00:29:46
 Why should we object like a priest between God and a devotee?

513
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
 Pujya is much more elevated today.

514
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
 Why do you object?

515
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
 There is a need.

516
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
 High, very high devotees.

517
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
 They are praying.
