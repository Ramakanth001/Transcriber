1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:07
 for that. They want that. He is capable of that. Will he refuse the desire of...on what

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:16
 basis he is refusing? Suppose you say he is refusing, for what purpose? Meaningless. Closing.

3
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
 Topic is closing.

4
00:00:19 --> 00:00:32
 Is he omnipotent or not? They don't know what I am going to play next year. They told,

5
00:00:32 --> 00:00:42
 hey, he is Omnipotent. All the four or five scholars, they shouted, he is Omnipotent.

6
00:00:42 --> 00:00:49
 Then is he having the potency, power to incarnate or not? If you say that he has no power to

7
00:00:49 --> 00:00:56
 incarnate, he is not Saraswati Maam. He is not having all powers. All powers but except

8
00:00:56 --> 00:01:03
 one power. That will not be Omnipotency. If you say that he has the power, there is a

9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:10
 need devotees are praying, requesting. He is very kind Lord. He is very kind to devotees.

10
00:01:10 --> 00:01:20
 He always do...he will do anything for the sake of devotees. Such a need is there and

11
00:01:20 --> 00:01:27
 he is potent, he is capable. Why you are objecting in between? Why you are standing in between

12
00:01:27 --> 00:01:34
 the two? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting?

13
00:01:34 --> 00:01:41
 Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why

14
00:01:41 --> 00:01:48
 you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not

15
00:01:48 --> 00:01:55
 objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting?

16
00:01:55 --> 00:02:05
 Then, Tharpatra Swamiji, he was so much pleased with me. He embraced me and told, I will give

17
00:02:05 --> 00:02:13
 sanyasa to you. You become the Peethasapati of Kashi Peetham. Kashi Shankara Peetham is

18
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
 the master of all the other four Peethas. Because Shankaracharya written Bhashya commentaries

19
00:02:19 --> 00:02:29
 only in Kashi. Then the Peethas, Tharpatra Swamiji, he is the author, he is Gita Hibbati.

20
00:02:29 --> 00:02:37
 As successor. Then I wrote to my father. Such a good opportunity came.

21
00:02:37 --> 00:02:52
 Age of 16, 17. 16 completed. Then my father wrote, you stop that education, come back

22
00:02:52 --> 00:03:00
 to home. I will not agree to you to take sanyasa because you are my eldest son. Eldest son is

23
00:03:00 --> 00:03:07
 responsible for all the pitrukarmas and the parents by. He is the aggigari actually. Tharpatra

24
00:03:07 --> 00:03:14
 is only eldest son. The other brothers only just they follow, they assist only. They just

25
00:03:14 --> 00:03:24
 follow only. The main tharpatra is the jesta putraha. The first eldest son. Objected. Then

26
00:03:24 --> 00:03:42
 I dropped from that idea. Then I wept for that. Then God that I appeared and told why

27
00:03:42 --> 00:03:50
 you are weak. I beseeched that golden chance. Moreover I studied this bloody science in

28
00:03:50 --> 00:03:57
 which I am not interested. I am interested in Sanskrit and philosophy. He did not allow

29
00:03:57 --> 00:04:05
 me to go in that line. He brought me in this science line which I don't like at all. I

30
00:04:05 --> 00:04:12
 like only philosophy and Sanskrit. Why you force me into this line? Then he told, he

31
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
 gave the explanation. Transcript you have studied in every previous birth you are a

32
00:04:18 --> 00:04:27
 science. Now the need is you have to teach the philosophy, spiritual knowledge to scientists,

33
00:04:27 --> 00:04:39
 not the Sanskrit scholars. The whole world is full of scientists. Even arts subjects

34
00:04:39 --> 00:04:46
 also can be called science, political science like that, social science. So science is everywhere.

35
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
 So you must study science. You have to preach spiritual knowledge to scientists, not to

36
00:04:51 --> 00:04:58
 old Sanskrit scholars. There are no Sanskrit scholars also now. Very little. Very countable

37
00:04:58 --> 00:05:06
 on fingers. Minor thing. That is why I made you to study science. Actually since I studied

38
00:05:06 --> 00:05:13
 science, I could tell that the trees do not have awareness, nervous system and brain.

39
00:05:13 --> 00:05:20
 They have only respiration. Pranam ekosha. Taking oxygen limit on the life. It is not

40
00:05:20 --> 00:05:26
 real awareness of life. Not real life. It is called as life. Pranam ekosha. But not

41
00:05:26 --> 00:05:33
 Manom ekosha. They are not undergoing pain. See this answer I could give only because

42
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
 I studied botany, Geology, Chemistry, B.Sc.

43
00:05:36 --> 00:05:59
 They have life. Yes. Even now we eat non-Hindutians. But see Boer's theory was not accepted by

44
00:05:59 --> 00:06:07
 all world scientists. He was not accepted by several scientists. He was not accepted.

45
00:06:07 --> 00:06:16
 See life means, you take life means only respiration which is a mechanical process. It has no awareness.

46
00:06:16 --> 00:06:23
 Trees are living beings. Animals are also living beings. But animals are living beings with

47
00:06:23 --> 00:06:33
 awareness. Trees are living beings without awareness. Life that, what are the life there

48
00:06:33 --> 00:06:44
 means only mechanical respiration process. It is not nervous system and brain. See real

49
00:06:44 --> 00:06:55
 life is awareness. Not the mechanical respiration. See we can prepare life system in the laboratory.

50
00:06:55 --> 00:07:02
 You can take a chemical reaction taking place in your vessel. You can send oxygen through

51
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
 one tube. That reaction takes place. Carbon dioxide is emitted. That you can take out

52
00:07:07 --> 00:07:14
 from one tube. You have created pranamaya question elaborated it. But you cannot create

53
00:07:14 --> 00:07:22
 awareness. You cannot create awareness. By any experiment you cannot create awareness.

54
00:07:22 --> 00:07:30
 Swami a person in coma state is as good as a plant. Can we consider that? Good as plant

55
00:07:30 --> 00:07:36
 means his brain nervous system is not working. That is why he is in coma state. Like a plant.

56
00:07:36 --> 00:07:44
 Like a plant. It is called vegetative state. Provided he is taking respiration. On ventilation.

57
00:07:44 --> 00:07:51
 Even on ventilation. Swami for human beings and animals. Here the point is respiration

58
00:07:51 --> 00:07:59
 is in plants. Respiration is in animals also. But in addition to respiration there is a

59
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
 nervous system in animals. That nervous system is the absentee plants.

60
00:08:03 --> 00:08:11
 Then I asked from Mahabharata Swami. Adat Dhargabhubhav debate is there. And they said there are

61
00:08:11 --> 00:08:17
 senses in the plants. Then you have to admit that. In fact they are the interpolated.

62
00:08:17 --> 00:08:26
 Adat you see in the instructions. Somebody will say Parvati Vasa, Shiva Bhuvasa. Parvati

63
00:08:26 --> 00:08:33
 told like this in Tantra Granthas. Always Shiva Bhuvasa, Parvati Vasa. Like that. In

64
00:08:33 --> 00:08:43
 the name of Parvati and Shiva they write. Then it will be accepted. Parvati also Shiva

65
00:08:43 --> 00:08:55
 Bhuvasa. Must be. That is incessance. That you need not worry. Have you taken audio video

66
00:08:55 --> 00:09:11
 cassette. Then Parvati asked and Shiva replied. So science helped me in that way. See while

67
00:09:11 --> 00:09:18
 telling the human incarnation has both human nature as well as the God's nature, divine

68
00:09:18 --> 00:09:25
 nature. I took the example electron. Electron has both wave nature and particle nature.

69
00:09:25 --> 00:09:37
 Dual nature of electron. Human incarnation I compared to the single phase system in which

70
00:09:37 --> 00:09:42
 two components are present. God component, human being component. But phase is single.

71
00:09:42 --> 00:09:49
 Human being only is seen. God component is not seen. So single phase in which two components

72
00:09:49 --> 00:09:56
 are present. See gold and copper are mixed. But it looks as gold only. 22 carats gold

73
00:09:56 --> 00:10:01
 looks like gold. Unless you put microscope and see gold atoms are different from copper

74
00:10:01 --> 00:10:10
 atoms. Spectrograph like that. So therefore while giving examples I could give many scientific

75
00:10:10 --> 00:10:18
 examples. Because I studied science. That is in Baha. That free energy explanation.

76
00:10:18 --> 00:10:33
 And that first law of thermodynamics also. Q is equal to delta E plus W. And reaction

77
00:10:33 --> 00:10:48
 is the slowest step. Slowest step of the reaction determines the whole time of the reaction.

78
00:10:48 --> 00:10:55
 Then once knowledge is obtained the bhakti is spontaneous. Karma yoga is spontaneous.

79
00:10:55 --> 00:11:02
 So the first step took 10 minutes. The other three steps are spontaneous. They took 10

80
00:11:05 --> 00:11:10
 minutes one second. In one second the other three steps are completed. So the overall

81
00:11:10 --> 00:11:16
 reaction time is only 10 minutes. The time taken by the first step is the overall time

82
00:11:16 --> 00:11:23
 of the entire reaction. That is why he told. Gyanarayam adh kaiwayam. By spiritual knowledge

83
00:11:23 --> 00:11:28
 you will get kaiwayam. That means when you get full spiritual knowledge automatically

84
00:11:28 --> 00:11:33
 spontaneously you get devotion. Spontaneously you will get practical devotion. Spontaneously

85
00:11:33 --> 00:11:42
 you will get fruit. The first step is very difficult. Slowest step. Acquiring the correct

86
00:11:42 --> 00:11:51
 and complete knowledge. So Gyanarayam adh kaiwayam. It can be supported. It does not

87
00:11:51 --> 00:11:56
 mean that theoretical devotion, practical devotion and fruit are absent. Strictly the

88
00:11:56 --> 00:12:03
 Gnana is giving the final product. The second step and third step are spontaneous. Their

89
00:12:03 --> 00:12:09
 time is not considered at all. It looks as soon as the first step of the reaction is

90
00:12:09 --> 00:12:17
 over the fruit has come. It looks like that. So Gyanarayam adh kaiwayam is justified. That

91
00:12:17 --> 00:12:31
 is why Shankara told like that. I could support Shankara by the reaction kind things. That

92
00:12:31 --> 00:12:39
 is why then he also told the reason for him to obstruct me from the sanyasa, becoming

93
00:12:39 --> 00:12:46
 Kashi Peethasipathy. He told the reason is if you become Kashi Peethasipathy only some

94
00:12:46 --> 00:12:53
 four or five Sanskrit scholars will become to you. And as Shankara Peethasipathy you

95
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
 cannot support Ramayana Maddha etc. You have to support only Shankara. You have to always

96
00:12:59 --> 00:13:08
 scold Ramayana Maddha. That is the rule of the Peetham. Is it not? So how can you propagate

97
00:13:08 --> 00:13:16
 the universal spirituality? In Hinduism itself you cannot oppose the sub religions. How can

98
00:13:16 --> 00:13:27
 you unite the religions of the entire world? That is why he stopped now. Gyanarayam thought

99
00:13:27 --> 00:13:36
 he will do all for his work. Maybe he is very attentive in his work. But when we ask some

100
00:13:36 --> 00:13:50
 fruit then he will become angry. His work he is very alert. If you ask salary he will

101
00:13:50 --> 00:14:03
 become irritated. If you show interest in his work he will very much believe. Not like

102
00:14:03 --> 00:14:17
 that. He has given lot of money. Lot of unimaginable amount he has given. Because he never tells

103
00:14:17 --> 00:14:31
 a lie. That is the sentence told by him. Unimaginable amount. I should not speak because if the

104
00:14:31 --> 00:14:49
 news goes to some income tax people I will be in trouble. So always I was going back.

105
00:14:49 --> 00:14:58
 I will not do this full time. I will do some job. In leisure time I will do this. I am

106
00:14:58 --> 00:15:03
 doing from the beginning like this only. Now what else I will do? I don't want anything

107
00:15:03 --> 00:15:11
 for doing your work. I don't want any fruit from you for your work. I will work for my

108
00:15:11 --> 00:15:18
 expenses, for my family expenses. I will work in the end. In leisure time I will dedicate

109
00:15:18 --> 00:15:28
 to you. That is what I told. I thinking as if he doesn't have any money. He is a poor

110
00:15:28 --> 00:15:36
 fellow. That is like see very difficult for you to pay. Let me earn my livelihood. I will

111
00:15:36 --> 00:15:47
 do free service to you. You must do full time work. I will give in a different way. I will

112
00:15:47 --> 00:15:58
 give in a different way. That is what he did. And he did it. He did it also not correctly.

113
00:15:58 --> 00:16:07
 When he told the statement the whole nature rearranged to fulfill his statement. It is

114
00:16:07 --> 00:16:16
 not his issue and did some work for that arrangement. When the sentence came from his mouth it has

115
00:16:16 --> 00:16:31
 to be done by the nature. We always speak as per the situation. But when he speaks the

116
00:16:31 --> 00:16:40
 situation follows his speech. Our speech will be following the situation. What is the actual

117
00:16:40 --> 00:16:47
 going on? We will study and then speak accordingly. Our speech follows the situation whereas

118
00:16:47 --> 00:16:54
 the situation follows his speech. That is the difference between God and soul.

119
00:16:54 --> 00:17:20
 That is the real experience. Once the statement came from his mouth it will feel like anything.

120
00:17:20 --> 00:17:31
 And the nature does the work with such a speed, tremendous speed. The work will be done with

121
00:17:31 --> 00:17:40
 tremendous speed because he is the ultimate God. He is that unimaginable God. He expressed

122
00:17:40 --> 00:17:47
 all fresh energetic incarnations. And the definition of God completely appraise in him.

123
00:17:47 --> 00:17:55
 He is only one. He does creation, maintenance and destruction of the world. These two are

124
00:17:55 --> 00:18:04
 the definitions of the God. Even Janmaadvishaya has Brahma Sutras. This is only given as definition.

125
00:18:04 --> 00:18:11
 This definition of God contains two aspects, two points. One is he is one. He does all

126
00:18:11 --> 00:18:18
 the three works, creation, ruling and destruction. These two points exactly visibly apply in

127
00:18:18 --> 00:18:25
 him. He is one person only. So Hekmaadvishaya Brahma that apply. He is having three faces.

128
00:18:25 --> 00:18:33
 With Brahma face he creates. With Vishnu face he rules. With Shiva face he destroys. Only

129
00:18:33 --> 00:18:40
 one personality. He does all the three works. That is the definition of ultimate God. That

130
00:18:40 --> 00:18:51
 is Brahma Jignasa. Brahma means ultimate God. That definition completely appraise in him.

131
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
 That is why he told,

132
00:18:53 --> 00:19:13
 According to Vedic definition, he is proved to be the ultimate God. This explanation has

133
00:19:13 --> 00:19:25
 not come so far about that. They say that he is born from Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.

134
00:19:25 --> 00:19:32
 That is also correct. But that incarnation is called as Dattaatreya. This is Datta. Datta

135
00:19:32 --> 00:19:42
 appeared for Atreya and Anasuya. In Bhagavatam, in Rotsha mountain, both did long penance.

136
00:19:42 --> 00:19:50
 And Datta appeared there. First Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva appeared. Atreya refused them. God is

137
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
 only one. He may do all the three activities together. But God is not a board of directors

138
00:19:56 --> 00:20:10
 of a company. He is only one. He refused all three. He refused. Then with three faces,

139
00:20:10 --> 00:20:21
 single God Datta appeared. Then Anasuya asked him to take birth in her womb. Then Brahma

140
00:20:21 --> 00:20:30
 born as Chandra, Vishnu born as Datta and Shiva born as Durvasa. Then Brahma and Shiva,

141
00:20:30 --> 00:20:36
 they gave their powers. They gave all their divinities to the central Datta. And Chandra

142
00:20:36 --> 00:20:43
 went and mixed with planets, Navagrahas. Durvasa went and mixed with sages. He is a

143
00:20:43 --> 00:20:51
 Rishi. After losing their divinities, he became a planet, he became a sage. From that time

144
00:20:51 --> 00:21:04
 Datta, Dattaatreya became Srimurcha. Not by birth. That is human incarnation. But this

145
00:21:04 --> 00:21:10
 is the first energetic incarnation which appeared to Atreya and Anasuya before the

146
00:21:10 --> 00:21:21
 birth of Dattaatreya. And since Anasuya requested, he is born as three sons. So Datta is different

147
00:21:21 --> 00:21:28
 from Dattaatreya. Datta is the original energetic incarnation, ultimate God. Dattaatreya is his

148
00:21:28 --> 00:21:40
 human incarnation. Datta is not the birth day of Datta. It is the birth day of Dattaatreya.

149
00:21:40 --> 00:22:02
 They both are one. They merged with each other. They become one only. That is how every incarnation

150
00:22:02 --> 00:22:13
 is. Unimaginable God enters every incarnation through God Datta. Because God Datta, Unimaginable

151
00:22:13 --> 00:22:20
 God merged. And you need not refer to Unimaginable God because he is beyond imagination. How

152
00:22:20 --> 00:22:33
 can you refer? Only you can refer him as the ultimate God. And here no Shaiva Matham and

153
00:22:33 --> 00:22:39
 Vaishnava Matham. All these are absent. All the three are present. And the inertial Brahma

154
00:22:39 --> 00:22:50
 is also added. It is three in one. Why should you leave Brahma? Who is the first form of

155
00:22:50 --> 00:23:02
 God creating the world? Only Vishnu and Shiva. Only after Brahma, only Vishnu and Shiva came.

156
00:23:02 --> 00:23:12
 First is Brahma. You have left Brahma completely. Nobody worships Brahma. So all these defects

157
00:23:12 --> 00:23:29
 are rectified. But Vedantists follow that ultimate God as Nidakara, Nirguna, who cannot

158
00:23:29 --> 00:23:38
 be even imagined. Bhagavad Gita says, avyatah gajar dukham deha vadhira vaapya te. If you

159
00:23:38 --> 00:23:47
 worship that Nirguna Param Brahma, you will get misery, you will get dukha only. Because

160
00:23:47 --> 00:23:56
 you cannot imagine even. How can you worship? When you can't imagine him, how can you worship?

161
00:23:56 --> 00:24:04
 He is like a naked person in the bathroom. Nobody can see him. He only can see himself.

162
00:24:04 --> 00:24:15
 That is God only knows God. Brahman knows only Brahman. Nobody other than him can see

163
00:24:15 --> 00:24:24
 him. He is naked in the bathroom. Only he can see himself. He knows about himself. No

164
00:24:24 --> 00:24:36
 other fellow can know him. So he became visible after dressing. That dressing is medium. He

165
00:24:36 --> 00:24:44
 became mediated God, Saguna Brahma. That is Nirguna Brahma in the bathroom. Outside he

166
00:24:44 --> 00:24:52
 came as Saguna Brahma. Even though he dressed, his face is seen, his palms are seen, legs

167
00:24:52 --> 00:25:00
 are seen. Some original is also seen. Then what is that seen? We told he is unimaginable

168
00:25:00 --> 00:25:12
 God. We are seeing his face, hands etc. What is that unimaginable expressed in God Datta?

169
00:25:12 --> 00:25:20
 Miracles. Miracles. What are miracles? Unimaginable events. Indicating the source of unimaginable

170
00:25:20 --> 00:25:32
 God. So unimaginable God is expressed through face, through hands, legs. Excellent. Excellent

171
00:25:32 --> 00:25:40
 point. Because by the miracles only, the unimaginable God is indicated. Unimaginable God is the

172
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
 source of unimaginable events called miracles.

173
00:25:44 --> 00:25:52
 As far as I know, I was thinking that we are Vedant is that we follow Parabrahma, ultimate

174
00:25:52 --> 00:26:00
 God. Parabrahman is monavyachya pravirata parabrahma ratnam, only silence. Because nothing

175
00:26:00 --> 00:26:10
 is understood. As far as avyatta he is getting dukkham. We are not Vedant. In one song also

176
00:27:10 --> 00:27:14
 we say that. We say that we are the Guru. He is the Guru Datta.

177
00:27:24 --> 00:27:28
 So 9 is enough, 9 has passed. Then you all should go home.

178
00:27:28 --> 00:27:38
 Swami spoke for 40 hours contribution to Gajar Mahara from Mumbai. He is now Swami

179
00:27:38 --> 00:27:56
 Keshavadri. See, if I don't speak the knowledge, like gases trouble, it will pain.

180
00:27:56 --> 00:28:08
 If I speak knowledge, then stomach is pain. My brain acts like a stomach. Like the stomach

181
00:28:08 --> 00:28:20
 is upset by gas, the brain is upset by knowledge. I speak, then something. And release is there.

182
00:28:26 --> 00:28:34
 So Krishna has to be well.

183
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 Yes, Swami.

184
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
 All of you.

185
00:28:44 --> 00:28:48
 Janakanna manna adhi na.

186
00:28:48 --> 00:28:54
 Real Krishna has to be Swami today.

187
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
 Gnanayeknam fire bathsvar.

188
00:28:58 --> 00:29:08
 Starting only Swami said that only discussing of the spiritual knowledge itself is the real

189
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
 festival. That's what could happen literally.

190
00:29:18 --> 00:29:24
 That's what you started, same word you started Swami. That's what happened. The real festival

191
00:29:24 --> 00:29:30
 happened. That is why he told Gnana Deepavali, Bhakti Deepavali. Deepavali is also Krishna's

192
00:29:30 --> 00:29:34
 festival. But it should be Gnana Deepavali and Bhakti Deepavali. Gnana and Bhakti are

193
00:29:34 --> 00:29:40
 one and the same. Because Gnana, I am hearing Gnana, you develop some inspiration on God.

194
00:29:40 --> 00:29:47
 That inspiration is not different from Gnana. That is what Shankara told. In Gita actually

195
00:29:47 --> 00:29:49
 two verses came.

196
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
 Priyohi Gnani no atyantam. Gnani sachamav priya.

197
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
 Another place, Bhaktas te ati mume priya.

198
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
 Devotee is the highest in one place.
