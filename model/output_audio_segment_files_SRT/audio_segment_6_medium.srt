1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:06
 In another place he told, Gnani is the highest.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
 Two superlatives cannot be for two objects.

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
 Superlative is only for one object.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
 Then Shankara wrote, Paramantha Gnanalaksha Rasa Sampan Naam Bhakti Michyadha.

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
 Gnana and bhakti both are one and the same.

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
 So for the superlative only one example, one item came.

7
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
 Gnana is not different from bhakti. Gnana produces bhakti.

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
 Bhakti is inspiration, abstract.

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
 It is always associated with Gnana.

10
00:00:38 --> 00:00:44
 As you get more and more Gnana, the more and more bhakti will be generated.

11
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
 So it is always associated with Gnana.

12
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
 So it is considered as one item only.

13
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
 That is why superlative is only one item.

14
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
 Like that he wrote, Paramantha.

15
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
 Because two things cannot be in one superlative.

16
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
 Highest means only one.

17
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
 So like that.

18
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
 Gnana gives bhakti.

19
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
 Thank you Swami.

20
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
 Give it so much of love.

21
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
 Lot of love.

22
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
 Anyway I enjoyed.

23
00:01:18 --> 00:01:24
 Very good. Krishnasami is celebrated in the best way.

24
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
 Excellent.

25
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
 Marvelous.

26
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
 All points you covered.

27
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
 Every point, all points.

28
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
 Explanation is excellent.

29
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
 Very beautiful.

30
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
 Babu, naa chathayindha dhokkate.

31
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
 Neekh okkadi gaya chathayindha dhokkate.

32
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
 Neekh kabaddi gaya chathayindha dhokkate.

33
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
 Neekh okkadi gaya chathayindha dhokkate.

34
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
 Neekh kabaddi gaya chathayindha dhokkate.

35
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
 That is also correct.

36
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
 I can do only one.

37
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
 One more.

38
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
 Many thanks.

39
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
 Namaste.

40
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
 Janmanko Jyotiratim.

41
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
 Janmanko Krishnashami.

42
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
 Namaste.

43
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
 That morning Ramachandra was telling

44
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
 this was the first Krishnashami

45
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
 and it was celebrated in online.

46
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
 First Krishnashami.

47
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
 First Krishnashami.

48
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
 I told because of our distinguished guest Chanda.

49
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
 I told because of our distinguished guest Chanda.

50
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
 Very fast.

51
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
 Online first Krishnashami.

52
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
 Yes.

53
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
 Excellent.

54
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
 She graced the occasion with her physical presence.

55
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
 She can recognize the Swamiji.

56
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
 I only speak the knowledge.

57
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
 She practices the knowledge.

58
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
 She is far far greater than me.

59
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
 She is far far greater than me.

60
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
 Because you preached only she could do Swamiji.

61
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
 Because you preached only she could do Swamiji.

62
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
 I only speak her.

63
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
 Practicing it.

64
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
 Because you preached it so

65
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
 that she could practice it.

66
00:03:10 --> 00:03:15
 See preaching is very easy but practicing is difficult.

67
00:03:15 --> 00:03:30
 Swami has to receive the practical services because he has to test.

68
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
 What you have understood has to be tested.

69
00:03:33 --> 00:03:45
 I will borrow the words from Nikhil Sir Swami. He said when the preacher is of highest order like God Datta, then even the lowest soul will perform in a climax way.

70
00:03:46 --> 00:03:51
 Excellent!

71
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
 But the higher picture is the highest God Datta.

72
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
 Practice is very difficult.

73
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
 Kama Yoga is very difficult. That is the final step.

74
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
 Excellent!

75
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
 Everybody will learn knowledge. Everybody will get inspiration.

76
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
 But nothing happens in practice.

77
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
 Tuss in practice.

78
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
 Among angels you are the highest. Among souls, Chanda Ji is the highest.

79
00:04:24 --> 00:04:36
 She is not highest. I actually gave the comment, how she is possible.

80
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
 That is the question which is not answered so far.

81
00:04:40 --> 00:04:46
 She did all Kama Phalakyaaga. All her gold and all her cash.

82
00:04:46 --> 00:04:53
 Then some two days back, she phoned to me and told, second time I want to Kama Phalakyaaga.

83
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
 Whatever I have in my bank balance, I want to give.

84
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
 Then she told, don't tell this to anybody.

85
00:05:00 --> 00:05:08
 I am telling to everybody and also telling, all of you don't tell anything.

86
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
 Like Ram Ram Rayaraj.

87
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
 Telling that?

88
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
 I am telling to everybody.

89
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
 Please, all of you.

90
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
 Don't tell anybody.

91
00:05:23 --> 00:05:33
 Already our minds are blocked with the first shock.

92
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
 Now she is prepared to be second time. Even before we are two different first time.

93
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
 Okay sir.

94
00:05:43 --> 00:05:55
 Come.

95
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
 Once Swami told, secret is always to be told.

96
00:05:59 --> 00:06:19
 I am also thinking that in this Kali Yuga, though it preach the whatever Krishna preach.

97
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
 That the Kama Phalakyaaga, Kama Phalakyaaga, Bhakti Yoga, Gnana Yoga, that sequence.

98
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
 All that I preach.

99
00:06:25 --> 00:06:34
 But this one, you see, Kama Phalakyaaga means doing sacrifice of heart there in wealth.

100
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
 Is it not?

101
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
 Everybody does.

102
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
 That is okay.

103
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
 But in Gita there is one sloka.

104
00:06:43 --> 00:06:59
 Actually, the word to be given to the devotee who does Kama Phalakyaaga.

105
00:06:59 --> 00:07:07
 All the air and wealth when he donates, he is called as Kama Phalakyaaga.

106
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
 There I got doubt.

107
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
 This is not possible.

108
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
 Especially in Kali Yuga this is not possible.

109
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
 So this line of verse in Gita should be deleted from Gita for Kali Yuga.

110
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
 Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga, Satchyaaga Chabhriyati.

111
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
 Gnana Kama Phalakyaaga.

112
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
 Better than meditation, Kama Phalakyaaga is better.

113
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
 But Kama Phalakyaaga means Siddhasitthi and Thabhakti.

114
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
 But there is another line in Gita.

115
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
 Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga, Satchyaaga Chabhriyati.

116
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
 Who does, who sacrifices all the air and wealth?

117
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
 He is called as Kama Phalakyaaga.

118
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
 Not everybody.

119
00:07:57 --> 00:08:03
 Siddhasitthi Yadavati Shade, that itself is very difficult.

120
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
 Because it is practical.

121
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
 Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga, Sattuprastha, Turama.

122
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
 Only two people I see.

123
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
 I don't see any other third person.

124
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
 Hardly to be counted on fingers.

125
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
 Especially this Kalimba, Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga is not there.

126
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
 But God Dakta gave me shock.

127
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
 He produced Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga.

128
00:08:35 --> 00:08:41
 He gave me shock.

129
00:08:41 --> 00:08:49
 My concept, his concept is not having any example in the world.

130
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
 No, this line, this Gita line.

131
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
 You say that my concept has no example?

132
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
 I will show you an example.

133
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
 He is a creator.

134
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
 He can create anything in his creation.

135
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
 He created it.

136
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
 Examples are these.

137
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
 So I was shocked.

138
00:09:17 --> 00:09:29
 I was similarly shocked when God Dakta explained me that Krishna's Navanita Chauriyam and Rasa Kriya are the chests of Eshnatrayam.

139
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
 Then my mind was blocked for one month.

140
00:09:33 --> 00:09:43
 Then this shock for the rest of my life and my mind was blocked.

141
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
 And she is preparing for second night.

142
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
 Please ask her to take some break. We are late.

143
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
 That's what I am telling.

144
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
 Already we are not completely relieved from the first shock.

145
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
 Let us at least recover.

146
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
 I promise, whatever you told I fulfilled.

147
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
 I told all, not to tell anybody.

148
00:10:13 --> 00:10:23
 You are very good.

149
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
 We are all very happy.

150
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
 We are also happy. Swami reminded us to leave early.

151
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
 Yes, yes. Because we have to go home and...

152
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
 Swami, one group photo.

153
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
 Yes, come on.

154
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
 One prayer, Swami.

155
00:10:41 --> 00:10:51
 Udvegara hita Santoshara hita Shanti samudra Sri datta Shanti samudra Sri datta

156
00:10:51 --> 00:11:03
 Shantiladhirbala tatvanyati Nirmikara jayalanta satchi Yogi raja gurupitha dheesha

00:11:03 --> 00:11:19

158
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
 Shanti samudra Sri datta

159
00:11:23 --> 00:11:27
 Om Shanti Shanti Shanti

160
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
 Namaskar, Sir.

161
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
 Namaste.

162
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
 Thank you.
