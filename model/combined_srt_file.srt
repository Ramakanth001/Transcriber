1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10
 So shall we start, Swami?

2
00:00:10 --> 00:00:40
 So shall we start, Swami?

3
00:00:40 --> 00:01:10
 Today we are celebrating Guru Purnima.

4
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
 See, Guru is nothing but to remove our ignorance.

5
00:01:16 --> 00:01:22
 See, Lord Datta, He is the Guru Datta.

6
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
 He always comes, incarnate Himself to remove our ignorance.

7
00:01:27 --> 00:01:33
 And our beloved Sri Ratna Swami is incarnation of Lord Datta

8
00:01:33 --> 00:01:41
 and came down in human form to give excellent knowledge and remove our ignorance

9
00:01:41 --> 00:01:46
 and showing in, taking us in a right direction and a right path.

10
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
 And we know in spirituality we have lot of questions

11
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
 and lot of twisted knowledge was also there.

12
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
 And Swami is correlated all the spiritual knowledge.

13
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
 Like today we are saying Guru Purnima is Vedavyaasa birthday.

14
00:02:06 --> 00:02:17
 Our Swami is correlated even all the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, Prasthana Trayam.

15
00:02:17 --> 00:02:22
 Not only that He correlated even the modern science up to this point.

16
00:02:22 --> 00:02:25
 Swami is giving excellent spiritual knowledge.

17
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
 Only He incarnate to remove our ignorance.

18
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
 Datta Swami is none other than the Lord Datta Himself.

19
00:02:32 --> 00:02:38
 And we are so fortunate that today directly we are meeting,

20
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
 we are talking, we are seeing our contemporary human incarnation.

21
00:02:42 --> 00:02:51
 It's so fortune that we can directly get all clarifications, all our doubts.

22
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
 He will clear all our doubts.

23
00:02:53 --> 00:03:00
 If everybody can ask whatever they got doubts, Swami will clear all our doubts.

24
00:03:00 --> 00:03:09
 I pray Swami please remove our ignorance and give your blessings to all of us.

25
00:03:09 --> 00:03:18
 So anybody have questions can ask, can question Swami, Swami can answer all the questions.

26
00:03:18 --> 00:03:23
 Shall I ask? Yes, yes.

27
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
 Aadha Namaskaram Swami, this is Bharat Krishna.

28
00:03:27 --> 00:03:38
 Swami my question is generally it is said that it will take millions of janmas to achieve the spiritual goal

29
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
 which is to please God that is the human incarnation of God.

30
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
 Why it takes so much time Swami?

31
00:03:45 --> 00:03:56
 See, in Bhagavad Gita there is one verse,

32
00:03:56 --> 00:04:02
 Adha Chayaram Nichchayatam Nishcham Vamanyaseyamrutam.

33
00:04:02 --> 00:04:14
 That means this soul, this individual soul dies in the night in deep sleep.

34
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
 And in the morning when you awake he is reborn.

35
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
 So one day in one life.

36
00:04:23 --> 00:04:32
 So many births means many days, not years, not lives, not even years.

37
00:04:32 --> 00:04:39
 Just one day morning he is born, night he dies in deep sleep.

38
00:04:39 --> 00:04:54
 Therefore if you take the right interpretation it means only after many days only you can get the salvation.

39
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
 That's all.

40
00:04:56 --> 00:05:05
 Here the question is why it takes so much time?

41
00:05:05 --> 00:05:20
 In Bhagavad Gita the verse says that this soul dies in deep sleep every night.

42
00:05:20 --> 00:05:26
 And in the morning when you wake up he is reborn.

43
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
 So one day in one life.

44
00:05:29 --> 00:05:34
 So many births means many days.

45
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
 So there is no need to worry about it.

46
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
 Thank you Swami, excellent.

47
00:05:42 --> 00:05:49
 Swami ji, I have one question.

48
00:05:49 --> 00:06:00
 With respect to having expectation of the fruit of a work that has been performed,

49
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
 should not be there to avoid tension.

50
00:06:03 --> 00:06:13
 But how can a work be done without having an intention of doing it for a particular fruit?

51
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
 That I am not able to understand.

52
00:06:18 --> 00:06:27
 So you see, you can have intention for some fruit.

53
00:06:27 --> 00:06:32
 You are working for it. To achieve the fruit you are doing work.

54
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
 That much initial intention is alright.

55
00:06:36 --> 00:06:44
 But during the entire course of work if you always think about the fruit only,

56
00:06:44 --> 00:06:53
 then your energy will be exhausted in thinking about the fruit and energy is limited always.

57
00:06:53 --> 00:07:02
 And that limited energy is spent in thinking about the fruit in the excitational way.

58
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
 Then there will be no energy to do the work.

59
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
 Then you will not get the fruit.

60
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
 Initially you can have some fixation of fruit.

61
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
 Later on you should not think about the fruit.

62
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
 If you go on thinking due to attraction towards fruit,

63
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
 if you go on thinking and worrying about the fruit,

64
00:07:22 --> 00:07:27
 all your energy will be spent in that worry, in that excitation,

65
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
 in thinking about the fruit only, then energy will be over.

66
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
 Energy is limited.

67
00:07:34 --> 00:07:39
 Then energy is not remaining to do the work.

68
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
 You will stop doing work in the middle itself.

69
00:07:43 --> 00:07:47
 And if the work is not completed, you will not get the fruit.

70
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
 Therefore you should not worry about the fruit.

71
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
 Once you start the work, you should not worry about the fruit.

72
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
 What he is asking is,

73
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
 we should not think about the fruits,

74
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
 we should go on working.

75
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
 How can we do the work if we do not think about the fruits?

76
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
 The answer to that is,

77
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
 we are working for the fruit.

78
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
 There is no wrong in deciding this at first.

79
00:08:17 --> 00:08:22
 But if you think about the fruit while working,

80
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
 being worry about the fruit,

81
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
 being excited while thinking about the fruit,

82
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
 with this, your energy will be spent.

83
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
 Then energy and power will not be there.

84
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
 Power will not work for you.

85
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
 Therefore, if you do not think about the fruit,

86
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
 you will not get the fruit.

87
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
 If you work completely, you will get the fruit.

88
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
 Therefore, if you do not think about the fruit,

89
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
 you should not be excited while thinking about it.

90
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
 If you are thinking about it, you cannot do the work.

91
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
 That is the meaning of it.

92
00:09:04 --> 00:09:12
 Thank you, Swamiji.

93
00:09:12 --> 00:09:31
 Namaste.

94
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
 Can I ask a question?

95
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
 Yes.

96
00:09:35 --> 00:09:40
 Swamiji, without any mistakes,

97
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
 someone cheated on us.

98
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
 How do we take care of that person?

99
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
 Without our mistakes,

100
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
 people cheat on us.

101
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
 How do we think about it?

102
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
 Is it our karma that that person has given us

103
00:10:01 --> 00:10:05
 to teach us some lessons?

104
00:10:05 --> 00:10:11
 You see, if you want to escape cheating,

105
00:10:11 --> 00:10:16
 you should have precaution.

106
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
 Prevention is better than cure.

107
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
 Okay, already somebody cheated

108
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
 and you underwent some loss.

109
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
 Now, the next method is

110
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
 to take care in the future.

111
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
 Take it as a lesson.

112
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
 First, if you go to the background,

113
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
 it is only due to past karma.

114
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
 You might have cheated that fellow

115
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
 in the past birth,

116
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
 and now he is cheating you.

117
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
 So that is a retarded case,

118
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
 mutual canceling.

119
00:11:01 --> 00:11:06
 So you cannot take action on him again.

120
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
 If it is a retarded case,

121
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
 you cannot do anything against that.

122
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
 If it is a fresh case,

123
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
 you have not cheated him in the previous birth.

124
00:11:17 --> 00:11:21
 Freshly he has cheated you now in this birth.

125
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
 In that case, you leave to God

126
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
 and don't have any revenge attitude, vengeance.

127
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
 Don't show vengeance.

128
00:11:33 --> 00:11:38
 Keep silent and leave to God and pray to God.

129
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
 If it is a fresh case,

130
00:11:40 --> 00:11:44
 God will certainly punish him, not only punish him.

131
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
 See, if he is punished,

132
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
 your loss will not be compensated.

133
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
 So you should not think about his punishment.

134
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59
 Punishing him, punishment means to reform him.

135
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
 By punishment,

136
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
 God is going to reform that sinner.

137
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
 It is only for reformation,

138
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
 not for vengeance, not for revenge.

139
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
 Even if he is punished,

140
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
 how your vengeance goes,

141
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
 your loss is lost, your loss is not compensated.

142
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
 What do you get by punishing him?

143
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
 Nothing you will get.

144
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
 Your loss is there.

145
00:12:28 --> 00:12:34
 So when you are thinking with revenge,

146
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
 vengeance attitude,

147
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
 your health is spoiled.

148
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
 Previous loss plus more loss.

149
00:12:43 --> 00:12:48
 So therefore, don't develop any revenge attitude.

150
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
 Keep silent, pray to God,

151
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
 and leave the result to God.

152
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
 Now God will certainly take action

153
00:12:58 --> 00:13:03
 because the case is now in the court of God.

154
00:13:03 --> 00:13:08
 God is the ruler of this entire world on any day.

155
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
 If the revenge is not taken,

156
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
 if the fellow is not punished,

157
00:13:14 --> 00:13:19
 it is a black mark on the administration of God.

158
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
 He is more worried.

159
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
 Why should you worry about his administration?

160
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
 Moreover, if he is punished,

161
00:13:27 --> 00:13:31
 you are not getting your loss compensated.

162
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
 Moreover, another third point is

163
00:13:34 --> 00:13:40
 that if you show revenge, vengeance attitude,

164
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
 on that fellow, what happens?

165
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
 For your revenge attitude,

166
00:13:46 --> 00:13:50
 he will be also punished by God.

167
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
 God will punish him,

168
00:13:53 --> 00:13:59
 but extra, he will be also punished for your revengeful attitude.

169
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
 Best example, you know Draupadi,

170
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
 injustice was done to Draupadi.

171
00:14:06 --> 00:14:13
 The Kauravas dragged her shari and tried to make her naked.

172
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
 So Kauravas are sinners.

173
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
 Draupadi is the victim.

174
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
 Kauravas are the criminals.

175
00:14:23 --> 00:14:29
 God has decided to punish Kauravas.

176
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
 But meanwhile,

177
00:14:31 --> 00:14:36
 Draupadi showed lot of revenge attitude towards Kauravas.

178
00:14:36 --> 00:14:41
 She was always weeping and crying and telling Bhima and Arjuna

179
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
 that unless you kill Dushyasana,

180
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
 bring blood, I will not fold my hair.

181
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
 Like that, she was always expressing vengeance,

182
00:14:52 --> 00:14:57
 revenge attitude towards the sinners.

183
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
 Anyway, for the sin of Kauravas,

184
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
 Kauravas were killed by Krishna.

185
00:15:04 --> 00:15:10
 Arjuna and Pandavas are only just nominal people.

186
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
 Actually, the killer is only Krishna.

187
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
 Krishna killed Kauravas.

188
00:15:15 --> 00:15:20
 And, since Draupadi was always showing

189
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
 vengeance, revenge attitude,

190
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
 what happened, you know, in the last day,

191
00:15:26 --> 00:15:31
 all the five sons of Draupadi were also killed by Yashoda Thama.

192
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
 What is the use of winning the war?

193
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
 If she wins the war,

194
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
 her sons shall become the kings.

195
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
 Then only it has meaning.

196
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
 So along with Kauravas, her five sons were killed

197
00:15:46 --> 00:15:50
 and no son of Draupadi became the king.

198
00:15:50 --> 00:15:55
 The kingdom which was won by the war.

199
00:15:55 --> 00:16:00
 So therefore, if it is a retarded case,

200
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
 if you have cheated him in the previous birth,

201
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
 now he has cheated, cancelled.

202
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
 No more punishment for the criminal.

203
00:16:09 --> 00:16:14
 If it is not a retarded case, if it is a fresh case,

204
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
 that is you have not cheated him in the previous birth,

205
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
 but now he has cheated you,

206
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
 okay, then also, you don't show

207
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
 any revenge attitude towards your enemy.

208
00:16:27 --> 00:16:31
 You just pray God,

209
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
 asking Him to do whatever He feels resisted.

210
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
 Whatever is to be done, you please do.

211
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
 You leave everything to God and pray God.

212
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
 Then God will give you compensation for your loss,

213
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
 plus God will punish them.

214
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
 But God will punish them not for revenge,

215
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
 your revenge or He has no revenge.

216
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
 He punishes them only for reformation,

217
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
 to reform the criminal.

218
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
 That is the aim of punishment.

219
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10
 And moreover, if He is punished,

220
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
 and if God is not compensating your loss,

221
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
 what is the use of punishing your criminals?

222
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
 What compensation you got?

223
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
 You got no compensation.

224
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
 So by punishing your enemy, you will not get any compensation.

225
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
 So don't think of punishing your enemy.

226
00:17:29 --> 00:17:32
 Leave it to God.

227
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
 God will punish your enemy and will also,

228
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
 because you did not show any revenge attitude,

229
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
 He will compensate your loss.

230
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
 That is the real benefit.

231
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
 Otherwise, if you show the attitude of vengeance,

232
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
 what happens?

233
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
 Your enemy will be punished,

234
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
 if it is not a retort case,

235
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
 but you will not be compensated by God.

236
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
 And by punishing your enemy, did you get compensation?

237
00:18:03 --> 00:18:06
 Nothing.

238
00:18:06 --> 00:18:09
 So wisdom wise people,

239
00:18:09 --> 00:18:16
 what they do, they never make any revengeful attitude.

240
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
 They will never show revengeful attitude.

241
00:18:19 --> 00:18:22
 They keep silent, leaving everything to the hands of God.

242
00:18:22 --> 00:18:25
 This is your administration.

243
00:18:25 --> 00:18:28
 You do whatever you want to do.

244
00:18:28 --> 00:18:31
 It is the administration of God.

245
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
 If that fellow is really a criminal,

246
00:18:34 --> 00:18:37
 and if that criminal is not punished,

247
00:18:37 --> 00:18:40
 the black mark will come to God.

248
00:18:40 --> 00:18:44
 Because it is God's administration that is going on everywhere.

249
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
 Not these governments which are present.

250
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
 These are all superficial governments.

251
00:18:50 --> 00:18:57
 But the actual final judgment is given by God,

252
00:18:57 --> 00:19:00
 and things will happen as per that judgment.

253
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
 So that is the best thing.

254
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
 I will tell you in Telugu.

255
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
 I will tell you in Telugu.

256
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
 It is a good one.

257
00:19:12 --> 00:19:21
 Someone cheated me.

258
00:19:21 --> 00:19:24
 What should I do?

259
00:19:24 --> 00:19:27
 Should I fight the cheaters?

260
00:19:27 --> 00:19:30
 Or should I sit quietly?

261
00:19:30 --> 00:19:33
 That is the question he asked.

262
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
 What I am saying is,

263
00:19:36 --> 00:19:39
 this could have been a retort case.

264
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
 In the previous life, you might have cheated him.

265
00:19:42 --> 00:19:45
 He cheated you in this life.

266
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
 We thought it was a retort case.

267
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
 You cannot punish him.

268
00:19:51 --> 00:19:54
 Because the cheats you did and his cheats, both were cancelled.

269
00:19:54 --> 00:19:57
 So there should be no further action.

270
00:19:57 --> 00:20:00
 You cannot do anything to him also.

271
00:20:00 --> 00:20:03
 There is no proof for that.

272
00:20:03 --> 00:20:06
 You might be feeling sad then.

273
00:20:06 --> 00:20:09
 The second thing is that it could have been a fresh case.

274
00:20:09 --> 00:20:12
 You did not cheat him.

275
00:20:12 --> 00:20:15
 But he cheated you in this life.

276
00:20:15 --> 00:20:18
 If you cheat him in a fresh way,

277
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
 you should be angry and scold him.

278
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
 You should be angry and scold him.

279
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
 You might be feeling sad.

280
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
 The question you should ask is,

281
00:20:30 --> 00:20:33
 if you punish him,

282
00:20:33 --> 00:20:36
 will your loss be fulfilled?

283
00:20:36 --> 00:20:39
 Will your loss be compensated?

284
00:20:39 --> 00:20:42
 It will not be.

285
00:20:42 --> 00:20:45
 What is your profit if he punishes you?

286
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
 So, will he escape without punishing him?

287
00:20:48 --> 00:20:51
 He will escape.

288
00:20:51 --> 00:20:54
 You have no profit because he punished you.

289
00:20:54 --> 00:20:57
 You have no loss because he punished you.

290
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
 So, you should think about it.

291
00:21:00 --> 00:21:03
 You should decide

292
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
 what you should do.

293
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
 You should leave it to God.

294
00:21:09 --> 00:21:12
 You should leave it to God and pray to God for your peace.

295
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
 Not for his loss.

296
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
 You should pray to God for your peace.

297
00:21:18 --> 00:21:21
 You should leave it to God.

298
00:21:21 --> 00:21:24
 God is the King of Kings.

299
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
 He is the final.

300
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
 All these are the government.

301
00:21:30 --> 00:21:33
 The underlying government

302
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
 is God's government.

303
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
 Jesus Christ says,

304
00:21:39 --> 00:21:42
 My father is a kingdom of the universe.

305
00:21:42 --> 00:21:45
 The kingdom of the universe is the government of God.

306
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
 The kingdom of the universe is the government of God.

307
00:21:48 --> 00:21:51
 So, that is the stable.

308
00:21:51 --> 00:21:54
 That is the actual mediterranean.

309
00:21:54 --> 00:21:57
 It is the final.

310
00:21:57 --> 00:22:00
 If you leave it to God,

311
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
 what will God do? He will punish you.

312
00:22:03 --> 00:22:06
 Why will he punish you?

313
00:22:06 --> 00:22:09
 Why will he punish you?

314
00:22:09 --> 00:22:12
 Why will he punish you?

315
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
 He will not punish you with a knife.

316
00:22:15 --> 00:22:18
 He will not punish you with a knife.

317
00:22:18 --> 00:22:21
 He will punish you to change his mind.

318
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
 He will punish you for reformation.

319
00:22:24 --> 00:22:27
 That is why he punishes you.

320
00:22:27 --> 00:22:30
 He punishes you if you are not a man.

321
00:22:30 --> 00:22:33
 If you scold him,

322
00:22:33 --> 00:22:36
 he will cancel your punishment.

323
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
 If you scold him,

324
00:22:39 --> 00:22:42
 he will cancel your punishment.

325
00:22:42 --> 00:22:45
 So, God punishes you.

326
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
 He will delay your punishment.

327
00:22:48 --> 00:22:51
 He will give you time to think about the change.

328
00:22:51 --> 00:22:54
 He will punish you and change you temporarily.

329
00:22:54 --> 00:22:57
 Punishment will be completed.

330
00:22:57 --> 00:23:00
 Punishment is not to teach you a lesson.

331
00:23:00 --> 00:23:03
 Punishment is to change you.

332
00:23:03 --> 00:23:06
 You can say,

333
00:23:06 --> 00:23:09
 I am not useful even if I get punished.

334
00:23:09 --> 00:23:12
 You can say,

335
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
 God will punish you

336
00:23:15 --> 00:23:18
 for being peaceful,

337
00:23:18 --> 00:23:21
 for being a teacher to God,

338
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
 for not showing your anger,

339
00:23:24 --> 00:23:27
 for being peaceful,

340
00:23:27 --> 00:23:30
 God will make you suffer.

341
00:23:30 --> 00:23:33
 If you are like this,

342
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
 this is the story of Draupadi.

343
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
 She was killed by the Christians.

344
00:23:39 --> 00:23:42
 They died because of the Christians.

345
00:23:42 --> 00:23:45
 They died because of the Christians.

346
00:23:45 --> 00:23:48
 They died because of the Christians.

347
00:23:48 --> 00:23:51
 They died because of the Christians.

348
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
 One day, Arjuna asked Yashodh,

349
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
 one of the Drona's disciples,

350
00:23:57 --> 00:24:00
 Yashodh came to Siva and said,

351
00:24:00 --> 00:24:03
 Grandfather,

352
00:24:03 --> 00:24:06
 when I fight,

353
00:24:06 --> 00:24:09
 I use arrows,

354
00:24:09 --> 00:24:12
 but when I use arrows,

355
00:24:12 --> 00:24:15
 before my arrow hits him,

356
00:24:15 --> 00:24:18
 I take a great sage, Trishula, and kill him.

357
00:24:18 --> 00:24:21
 After he dies, my arrow hits him.

358
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
 Who is that great sage?

359
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
 Then the Drona said,

360
00:24:27 --> 00:24:30
 You have done penance for Pashupatastra,

361
00:24:30 --> 00:24:33
 and I will tell you that

362
00:24:33 --> 00:24:36
 the sage is killing your enemies.

363
00:24:36 --> 00:24:39
 I will tell you that the sage is killing your enemies.

364
00:24:39 --> 00:24:42
 That is why

365
00:24:42 --> 00:24:45
 God will punish them.

366
00:24:45 --> 00:24:48
 He will definitely punish them.

367
00:24:48 --> 00:24:51
 You will not be able to fight because of the punishment.

368
00:24:51 --> 00:24:54
 I am talking about Draupadi.

369
00:24:54 --> 00:24:57
 Draupadi was insulted.

370
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
 He decided to kill the Drona,

371
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
 but he killed him.

372
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
 He was so angry that he decided to kill him.

373
00:25:06 --> 00:25:09
 He was so angry that he decided to kill him.

374
00:25:09 --> 00:25:12
 He was so angry that he decided to kill him.

375
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
 He was so angry that he decided to kill him.

376
00:25:15 --> 00:25:18
 He was so angry that he decided to kill him.

377
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21
 He was so angry that he decided to kill him.

378
00:25:21 --> 00:25:24
 He was so angry that he decided to kill him.

379
00:25:24 --> 00:25:27
 The sage killed the Drona

380
00:25:27 --> 00:25:30
 and the sage killed the Drona.

381
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
 He was in a state of peace

382
00:25:33 --> 00:25:36
 because he could not keep his mouth shut.

383
00:25:36 --> 00:25:39
 He killed five of his children.

384
00:25:39 --> 00:25:42
 He was in a state of peace

385
00:25:42 --> 00:25:45
 because he could not keep his mouth shut.

386
00:25:45 --> 00:25:48
 Why did he want to fight?

387
00:25:48 --> 00:25:51
 He wanted to make his children kings.

388
00:25:51 --> 00:25:53
 What happened to the children?

389
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
 All the children died.

390
00:25:55 --> 00:26:00
 So, that's how your mouth is punished.

391
00:26:00 --> 00:26:03
 So, your mouth is a district.

392
00:26:03 --> 00:26:07
 You should stop and be calm.

393
00:26:07 --> 00:26:10
 This is the kingdom of Bhagavan.

394
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
 This is the administration of Bhagavan.

395
00:26:12 --> 00:26:17
 If the person who has done wrong to you is not punished,

396
00:26:17 --> 00:26:20
 then the next black mark will come to Bhagavan.

397
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
 Why will it come to you?

398
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
 Right?

399
00:26:24 --> 00:26:26
 It will come to Bhagavan.

400
00:26:26 --> 00:26:30
 He will stop and tell the black mark.

401
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33
 He is really worried.

402
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36
 He should be worried, not you.

403
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
 You are the one who is fighting for his administration and his black mark.

404
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
 You should fight for him.

405
00:26:45 --> 00:26:46
 Right?

406
00:26:46 --> 00:26:54
 So, when you stop and fight for his administration,

407
00:26:54 --> 00:26:57
 you should stop and fight for Bhagavan.

408
00:26:57 --> 00:26:59
 You should stop and fight for him.

409
00:26:59 --> 00:27:01
 I would have cheated him in the past life.

410
00:27:01 --> 00:27:03
 He would have cheated me in the future life.

411
00:27:03 --> 00:27:05
 It has been cancelled.

412
00:27:05 --> 00:27:08
 You should stop and fight for him.

413
00:27:08 --> 00:27:10
 You should stop and fight for Bhagavan.

414
00:27:10 --> 00:27:13
 Why is the black mark coming to him?

415
00:27:13 --> 00:27:15
 You are not getting anything.

416
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
 You are staying calm.

417
00:27:17 --> 00:27:19
 He is coming with the black mark.

418
00:27:19 --> 00:27:21
 That is why he is not quiet.

419
00:27:21 --> 00:27:23
 He will punish.

420
00:27:23 --> 00:27:25
 Even in that punishment,

421
00:27:25 --> 00:27:27
 he did not do it for vengeance,

422
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
 but for revenge.

423
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
 For reformation.

424
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
 To change his mind.

425
00:27:33 --> 00:27:35
 He is punishing to change his behavior.

426
00:27:35 --> 00:27:37
 You are asking for punishment,

427
00:27:37 --> 00:27:39
 but not to change his behavior.

428
00:27:39 --> 00:27:41
 You are going to be in trouble.

429
00:27:41 --> 00:27:43
 You are also different from Bhagavan.

430
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
 You are not the one who is not punished.

431
00:27:45 --> 00:27:47
 You are asking for punishment,

432
00:27:47 --> 00:27:49
 but not to change your behavior.

433
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
 He is not able to punish,

434
00:27:51 --> 00:27:53
 but he will punish,

435
00:27:53 --> 00:27:55
 but he will not speak.

436
00:27:55 --> 00:27:57
 He is punishing to change his behavior.

437
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
 He is also punishing to help.

438
00:27:59 --> 00:28:01
 That is why he is doing it.

439
00:28:01 --> 00:28:03
 He is not quiet.

440
00:28:03 --> 00:28:05
 So, the reason is,

441
00:28:05 --> 00:28:07
 because you are staying calm,

442
00:28:07 --> 00:28:09
 because you are not asking for punishment,

443
00:28:09 --> 00:28:11
 because you are not asking for revenge,

444
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
 he will compensate for your loss.

445
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
 He will punish you.

446
00:28:15 --> 00:28:17
 He is also punishing.

447
00:28:17 --> 00:28:19
 Now, tell me what is the benefit.

448
00:28:19 --> 00:28:21
 Another thing,

449
00:28:21 --> 00:28:23
 he is punishing to shout.

450
00:28:23 --> 00:28:25
 You are also being punished.

451
00:28:25 --> 00:28:27
 Did you hear what he said?

452
00:28:27 --> 00:28:29
 He is punishing to shout.

453
00:28:29 --> 00:28:31
 He is punishing to shout.

454
00:28:31 --> 00:28:33
 He is punishing to shout.

455
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
 He is punishing to shout.

456
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
 He is punishing to shout.

457
00:28:37 --> 00:28:39
 He is also punishing to shout.

458
00:28:39 --> 00:28:41
 Why?

459
00:28:41 --> 00:28:43
 Because he is not talking.

460
00:28:43 --> 00:28:45
 He is talking.

461
00:28:45 --> 00:28:47
 Because he is not talking,

462
00:28:47 --> 00:28:49
 he is being punished.

463
00:28:49 --> 00:28:51
 He is being punished.

464
00:28:51 --> 00:28:53
 He is being punished

465
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
 because he is not being compensated.

466
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
 He is being punished.

467
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
 That is the duty of a God.

468
00:28:59 --> 00:29:01
 That is the duty of a God.

469
00:29:01 --> 00:29:03
 It is a duty of a God

470
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
 to punish the one who sins,

471
00:29:05 --> 00:00:07
 Questioner 1 – Swamiji, you have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

472
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
 Swamiji – I have not reached them.

473
00:00:10 --> 00:00:14
 Questioner 1 – Swamiji, you have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

474
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
 Swamiji – I have not reached them.

475
00:00:16 --> 00:00:22
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

476
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

477
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

478
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

479
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

480
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

481
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

482
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

483
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

484
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

485
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

486
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

487
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

488
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

489
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

490
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

491
00:01:04 --> 00:01:07
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

492
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

493
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

494
00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

495
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

496
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

497
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

498
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

499
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
 Swamiji – I have reached the small stars, Swamiji.

500
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
 Okay, let me do everything.

501
00:01:34 --> 00:01:54
 Okay.

502
00:01:54 --> 00:02:09
 Swamiji, human incarnation of God is compared to sugar and devotee is compared as ant.

503
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
 Ramakrishna.

504
00:02:11 --> 00:02:22
 Swamiji, in other context, even a prostitute also can be compared as sugar and the vitlu...

505
00:02:22 --> 00:02:31
 Prostitute is like sugar, it can be compared to ears, it can be compared to sex.

506
00:02:31 --> 00:02:38
 Syphilis, Gneria, it can be compared to ears also.

507
00:02:38 --> 00:02:47
 What is your doubt?

508
00:02:47 --> 00:02:57
 Even in prostitution, even they sing good songs to God.

509
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
 Now, I am saying that Gopikas were sages in previous births.

510
00:03:03 --> 00:03:12
 So, now in their last birth, they are offering their body to God.

511
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18
 In the same in Nivruthi case, if a prostitute wants to get liberation,

512
00:03:18 --> 00:03:27
 why should she use the money she got when she was in that prostitute's body?

513
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
 Why should she not get liberated?

514
00:03:30 --> 00:03:37
 See, someone behind me killed a war.

515
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
 He killed a war and made a sin,

516
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
 he cut his skin, hit him with a shovel and offered his body to God.

517
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
 The sin is going away.

518
00:03:50 --> 00:03:57
 He killed a war, cut his skin, hit him with a shovel and offered his body to God.

519
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
 Oh, my! My child is gone.

520
00:04:00 --> 00:04:08
 In fact, prostitution is a sin.

521
00:04:08 --> 00:04:13
 In prostitution, the sin is to get a good life.

522
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
 I am singing songs to God, I am offering my body to God.

523
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
 I am a sinner.

524
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
 I am offering my body to God.

525
00:04:24 --> 00:04:29
 If I give the money I earned to God, it is not a sin.

526
00:04:29 --> 00:04:34
 We should earn according to our religion.

527
00:04:34 --> 00:04:41
 According to our religion, our family members are also being exploited.

528
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
 They come up.

529
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
 This is how the word of injustice is.

530
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
 The war of injustice is a war of co-existence.

531
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
 You earned 10 rupees in a fair way.

532
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
 You earned a quarter of a rupee unjustly.

533
00:04:56 --> 00:05:01
 The money is linked to the 10 rupees.

534
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
 Railways have a platform.

535
00:05:04 --> 00:05:09
 The railway engine is linked to everything.

536
00:05:09 --> 00:05:12
 The whole platform is linked to the money.

537
00:05:12 --> 00:05:18
 The money earned unjustly is linked to the 10 rupees.

538
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
 You earned 10 rupees unjustly.

539
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
 I earned two quarters of a rupee unjustly.

540
00:05:26 --> 00:05:32
 You earned a quarter of a rupee unjustly.

541
00:05:32 --> 00:05:37
 The money earned according to religion is linked to the 10 rupees.

542
00:05:37 --> 00:05:42
 The railway engine is linked to everything.

543
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
 The money earned in the previous religion is linked to everything.

544
00:05:47 --> 00:05:51
 The money is linked to everything.

545
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
 Every single thing is being exploited.

546
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
 Why do we earn?

547
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
 Because we are in the middle of the world.

548
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
 That is the only desire.

549
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
 It does not work.

550
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
 They are being exploited.

551
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
 Every single thing.

552
00:06:10 --> 00:06:18
 The money gained unjustly will only be exploited once the money is there.

553
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
 They are in the middle of the world.

554
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
 The money gained unjustly will only be exploited once the money is there.

555
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
 It does not work.

556
00:06:28 --> 00:06:37
 They are in the middle of the world.

557
00:06:37 --> 00:06:44
 If you give it to the Lord, let us assume that the Lord will always save it, accept it.

558
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
 If you give it to the Lord, let us assume that the Lord will always save it, accept it.

559
00:06:49 --> 00:06:54
 If you give it to the Lord, let us assume that the Lord will always save it, accept it.

560
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
 If you give it to the Lord, let us assume that the Lord will always save it, accept it.

561
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
 If you give it to the Lord, let us assume that the Lord will always save it, accept it.

562
00:07:02 --> 00:07:09
 When the Lord will always save it, accept it, from then on you will be unjust.

563
00:07:09 --> 00:07:15
 You will realize repentance and non-repentance.

564
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
 If these three come together, it is reformation.

565
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
 We know that this is a sin.

566
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
 Realization.

567
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
 Repentance.

568
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
 You will feel sad that you have sinned.

569
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
 Non-repentance.

570
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
 You should not repeat the sin again in your life.

571
00:07:32 --> 00:07:38
 Then these sins and the sins done in the past will be completely cancelled.

572
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
 Completely cancelled.

573
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
 If you do these three.

574
00:07:44 --> 00:07:49
 Some people do realization, repentance and non-repetition.

575
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
 The sin done in the morning is forgiven in the evening.

576
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
 The sin done in the night is forgiven in the morning.

577
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
 The sin done in the morning is forgiven in the morning.

578
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
 Now I am free.

579
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
 I will sin again in the morning.

580
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
 Then I will forgive in the evening.

581
00:08:05 --> 00:08:06
 It is not forgotten.

582
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
 It is not red.

583
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
 It is not red.

584
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
 Red is coming and washing it.

585
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
 It is free.

586
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
 It is pure.

587
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
 It is pure.

588
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
 That is the principle.

589
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
 It works.

590
00:08:21 --> 00:08:24
 Non-repetition of the sin.

591
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
 Realization.

592
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
 You realized that this is a sin.

593
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
 You repented for it.

594
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
 You should not repeat it again.

595
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
 After these three.

596
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
 Not only that sin.

597
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
 The sins done in the past.

598
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
 Everything is forgiven.

599
00:08:45 --> 00:08:50
 The best Vedic.

600
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
 Everything.

601
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
 The sins done in the past.

602
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
 Not all sins.

603
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
 That type of sins.

604
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
 You committed theft.

605
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
 You realized.

606
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
 You did non-repetition without committing theft.

607
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
 The thefts done in the past will be cancelled.

608
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
 But the other types of sins.

609
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
 The other types.

610
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
 If you do non-repetition of that type.

611
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
 That file will be cancelled.

612
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
 If you do not do any sin.

613
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
 That will be cancelled.

614
00:09:25 --> 00:09:31
 So that is the knowledge.

615
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
 The best of the best.

616
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
 That is.

617
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
 The non-repetition.

618
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
 Not to repeat.

619
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
 In life.

620
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
 When you realize that.

621
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
 The whole process will be completed.

622
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
 But what are they doing?

623
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
 They are realizing.

624
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
 They are repenting.

625
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
 Confession.

626
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
 The sin committed in the past.

627
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
 Confession in the past.

628
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
 Confession in the past.

629
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
 That is not the reason.

630
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
 It will not be cancelled.

631
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
 Confession will not cancel the sin.

632
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
 Non-repetition.

633
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
 They will not repeat it.

634
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
 If they repeat it.

635
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
 All the sins will be cancelled.

636
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
 Not only this sin.

637
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
 All the sins will be cancelled.

638
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
 Because.

639
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
 The logic is.

640
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
 All the sins are being cancelled.

641
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
 What is the purpose of sin?

642
00:10:30 --> 00:10:32
 Reformation.

643
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
 Reformation.

644
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
 When you come to that reformation.

645
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
 Why do you do more sin?

646
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
 When you have already done.

647
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
 When you have already done.

648
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
 It is not necessary to do more sin.

649
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
 That is the logic.

650
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
 Punishment is only for reformation.

651
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
 And punishment is not for vengeance.

652
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
 And punishment is not for revenge.

653
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
 Punishment is not for revenge.

654
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
 Punishment is to get reformation.

655
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
 Punishment is to get reformation.

656
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
 Punishment is to get reformation.

657
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
 He killed one.

658
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
 He is doing more sin.

659
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
 Do you know why?

660
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
 Because he is not killing the second person.

661
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
 Suppose he is really killing the second person.

662
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
 What is the purpose of his more sin?

663
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
 Why do you do more sin?

664
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
 Because it is waste.

665
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
 Why do you do more sin?

666
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
 Because it is waste.

667
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
 That is the logic.

668
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
 Okay?

669
00:11:26 --> 00:11:32
 Namaste Swamiji.

670
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
 Namaste.

671
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
 I am Adiv Mandal here from Mumbai.

672
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
 Yes, yes, yes.

673
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
 Tell me.

674
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
 On this auspicious

675
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
 Guru Gurudwara Nima day,

676
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
 I offer my sincere gratitude

677
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
 and a total prostrated pranam

678
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
 to your divine lotus feet.

679
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
 Okay, thank you.

680
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
 And to my appeal,

681
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
 regarding my weak and

682
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
 unrest mind, you have said

683
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
 that I assured you,

684
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
 you will succeed in getting your problem cured.

685
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
 Your words came true

686
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
 in all aspects of my mental health.

687
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
 Later, recently

688
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
 on my query on my better health condition,

689
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
 you have said,

690
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
 you will get my guidance

691
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
 as you proceed in the work.

692
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
 But I also wanted

693
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
 to go in the direction of God,

694
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
 which is a permanent solution.

695
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
 And there, you have also said,

696
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
 you will have to face

697
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
 a lot of strain in working

698
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
 for God.

699
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
 Kindly elaborate further on this,

700
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
 as I am ready to go to any extent

701
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
 to prove that I could come

702
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
 close to you, Swamiji,

703
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
 in my life.

704
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
 Okay, very good.

705
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
 You are blessed.

706
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
 Thank you, Swamiji.

707
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
 You will get a proper

708
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
 guidance.

709
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
 You need not do

710
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
 too much work also, you need not do.

711
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
 You can do as per your

712
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
 health permits,

713
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
 as per your capacity permits,

714
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
 as per your energy permits.

715
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
 That is sufficient

716
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
 for God. Whether you are interested

717
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
 in doing practical work

718
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
 for my case or not,

719
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
 that is only the test of God.

720
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
 He is not in need of

721
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
 any work from us.

722
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
 If there is any need,

723
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
 then the fellow will

724
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
 think, if he does more work,

725
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
 my work will be bored

726
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
 and all done. Not like that.

727
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
 God is only testing

728
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
 whether you are

729
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
 only theoretical or practical.

730
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
 Also,

731
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
 practical is the proof

732
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
 for theory.

733
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
 Practical devotion is

734
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
 the proof for theoretical devotion.

735
00:13:42 --> 00:13:46
 Theoretical devotion

736
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
 without practical devotion

737
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
 is false

738
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
 love.

739
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
 It is not true love.

740
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
 Unless you sacrifice something practically,

741
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
 unless you do

742
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
 some service practically,

743
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
 service means

744
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
 sacrifice of energy,

745
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
 physical energy.

746
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
 Sacrifice of

747
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
 fruit of work.

748
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
 That is, first is

749
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
 Karma Sanyasa, another is Karma

750
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
 Phalakshayaga. Both these together

751
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
 are called as Karma Yoga.

752
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
 Karma Yoga is

753
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
 the proof for Bhakti Yoga.

754
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
 Bhakti Yoga is

755
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
 theoretical devotion.

756
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
 Karma Yoga is practical devotion.

757
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
 Practical devotion is the

758
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
 proof for the truth

759
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
 of theoretical devotion.

760
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
 Whether your

761
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
 Bhakti is real or false,

762
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
 that Karma Yoga decides.

763
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
 The practical devotion decides.

764
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
 Otherwise, simply

765
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
 gas.

766
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
 You sing so many songs,

767
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
 shed tears,

768
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
 then God will say,

769
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
 He will also sing songs on you,

770
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
 He will also shed tears,

771
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
 or if you want a boon

772
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
 for that, oh,

773
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
 you get more sweeter voice,

774
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
 He will let you get more tears

775
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
 from your eyes.

776
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
 So for theoretical

777
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
 devotion, theoretical boon.

778
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
 For practical devotion, practical boon.

779
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
 So actually in our India,

780
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
 we are very, very much

781
00:15:26 --> 00:15:28
 very, highly

782
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
 experts in theoretical

783
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
 devotion.

784
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
 That is why once

785
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
 somebody asked, Swami

786
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
 Vivekananda looked at this guy

787
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
 and asked God,

788
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
 why in our country,

789
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
 in India, so much devotion,

790
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
 so much knowledge is there,

791
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
 but still why they are poor?

792
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
 Somebody has put that question to me, directed that question

793
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
 to me. Then I told,

794
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
 yes, our India

795
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
 is very great in

796
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
 knowledge, spiritual knowledge, Gnana Yoga.

797
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
 And experts

798
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
 in Bhakti Yoga,

799
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
 singing songs on God,

800
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
 but will not give

801
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
 a single rupee for a poor fellow.

802
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
 In practical devotion,

803
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
 they are zero.

804
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
 In foreign countries,

805
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
 they are

806
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
 least Gnana Yoga, very least

807
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
 Bhakti Yoga, but they do charity,

808
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
 practical charity they do much.

809
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
 That is why they are rich countries,

810
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
 our country is poor country.

811
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
 That is the reason.

812
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
 We are experts in theoretical

813
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
 devotion, theoretical knowledge.

814
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
 So for theoretical knowledge

815
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
 and theoretical devotion, God gave

816
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
 theoretical boons. Let your

817
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
 knowledge increase more, let your

818
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
 brain become more intelligent,

819
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
 let your voice become more

820
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
 sweet, let more tears

821
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
 come while you sing songs,

822
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
 let your audience also

823
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
 shed tears,

824
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
 more tears.

825
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
 So theoretical devotion

826
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
 means theoretical boons.

827
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
 Ye yadhamam prapadyante

828
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
 tamstadhaiva bhajanyam

829
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
 In whatever way you approach

830
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
 me, I approach

831
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
 ye gaiyim by the same way.

832
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
 If you come by bus,

833
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
 I will come by bus.

834
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
 If you come by train, I will come by train.

835
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
 If you come by aeroplane, I will come by aeroplane.

836
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
 In Veda also it is told,

837
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
 rupam rupam prithu rupam bhuvah

838
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
 I am just your reflection,

839
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
 your mirror reflection.

840
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
 Whatever you,

841
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
 in whatever way you approach,

842
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
 if you show your intelligence,

843
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
 I will show a lot of intelligence.

844
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
 It will give you

845
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
 a lot of fruit.

846
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
 If you show innocence,

847
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
 I will be also innocent.

848
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
 Herod has asked

849
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
 that he should not be killed by

850
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
 such, such things, such things,

851
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
 either day or night, or inside or outside,

852
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
 or weapons with

853
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
 awareness or without awareness,

854
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
 like that, so many conditions.

855
00:18:08 --> 00:18:10
 All the conditions

856
00:18:10 --> 00:18:12
 he has broken.

857
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
 And for every condition he neutralized.

858
00:18:14 --> 00:18:16
 And killed Hirayana Vishnu.

859
00:18:16 --> 00:18:20
 He should not be,

860
00:18:20 --> 00:18:22
 he should not belong to a single race,

861
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
 man or animal

862
00:18:24 --> 00:18:26
 or Deva or Asura,

863
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
 Gandharva,

864
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
 Narasimha.

865
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
 Neither man nor animal.

866
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
 Neither inside nor outside,

867
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
 at the center of the gate.

868
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
 It is neither outside nor inside.

869
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
 Nor on the floor, nor on the sky.

870
00:18:46 --> 00:18:50
 He has put on his laps.

871
00:18:50 --> 00:18:52
 It is neither floor nor on the sky.

872
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
 Like that, for every thing he has

873
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
 shown me, God is the exception.

874
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
 He is very intelligent.

875
00:19:00 --> 00:19:04
 You show your intelligence

876
00:19:04 --> 00:19:06
 to other human beings.

877
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
 But when you come before

878
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
 God, kindly shut

879
00:19:10 --> 00:19:12
 up your intelligence.

880
00:19:12 --> 00:19:14
 Be innocent.

881
00:19:14 --> 00:19:16
 Be frank with him.

882
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
 Don't show

883
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
 your intelligence.

884
00:19:20 --> 00:19:24
 If he enters into the game,

885
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
 your address will not be there.

886
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
 So don't play with him.

887
00:19:30 --> 00:19:32
 Be frank.

888
00:19:32 --> 00:19:34
 Be sincere.

889
00:19:34 --> 00:19:36
 Be truthful.

890
00:19:36 --> 00:19:38
 Then you will get something from him.

891
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
 If you show intelligence,

892
00:19:40 --> 00:19:42
 you are finished.

893
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
 So you see Sudama,

894
00:19:46 --> 00:19:48
 how innocent he is.

895
00:19:48 --> 00:19:50
 He gave three handfuls

896
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
 of pastured rice.

897
00:19:52 --> 00:19:54
 Did not ask anything.

898
00:19:54 --> 00:19:56
 He came back to his house.

899
00:19:56 --> 00:19:58
 He never thought

900
00:19:58 --> 00:20:00
 about anything

901
00:20:00 --> 00:20:02
 returned from him.

902
00:20:02 --> 00:20:04
 And when he came back to his house,

903
00:20:04 --> 00:20:06
 unimaginable

904
00:20:06 --> 00:20:08
 wealth he gave.

905
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
 Because he is innocent.

906
00:20:10 --> 00:20:12
 See, his

907
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
 wife sent him to Krishna

908
00:20:14 --> 00:20:16
 to get something.

909
00:20:16 --> 00:20:18
 He was so poor.

910
00:20:18 --> 00:20:20
 But that fellow did not

911
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
 speak anything.

912
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
 Krishna asked him to stay for four days.

913
00:20:24 --> 00:20:26
 He stayed four days.

914
00:20:26 --> 00:20:28
 Then he told, I will go to my

915
00:20:28 --> 00:20:30
 home. Yes,

916
00:20:30 --> 00:20:32
 go. Like that he told.

917
00:20:32 --> 00:20:34
 He did not give any

918
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
 one rupee.

919
00:20:36 --> 00:20:38
 You know when he was washing his feet

920
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
 when he came,

921
00:20:40 --> 00:20:42
 there was a thorn

922
00:20:42 --> 00:20:44
 in his feet.

923
00:20:44 --> 00:20:46
 He was not

924
00:20:46 --> 00:20:48
 having the sensitivity of that thorn.

925
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
 He was not having any

926
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
 chappals to his

927
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
 feet. So when he

928
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
 came and when he was washing,

929
00:20:56 --> 00:20:58
 all his eight wives were pouring

930
00:20:58 --> 00:21:00
 water and he was washing

931
00:21:00 --> 00:21:02
 his feet. And that thorn

932
00:21:02 --> 00:21:04
 hit his

933
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
 palm.

934
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
 Then he plucked

935
00:21:08 --> 00:21:10
 out.

936
00:21:10 --> 00:21:12
 From that time

937
00:21:12 --> 00:21:14
 onwards,

938
00:21:14 --> 00:21:16
 there is no need

939
00:21:16 --> 00:21:18
 of the eight wives to pour water

940
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
 with gold vessels.

941
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
 Because

942
00:21:22 --> 00:21:24
 he washed his feet

943
00:21:24 --> 00:21:26
 with the water of his eyes.

944
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
 From that time onwards,

945
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
 he washed his feet with his

946
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
 tears.

947
00:21:32 --> 00:21:34
 Water was not necessary.

948
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
 Satchakrishna,

949
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
 he doesn't

950
00:21:38 --> 00:21:40
 have any chappals.

951
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
 Now he is going back to his home.

952
00:21:42 --> 00:21:44
 Hey, Sudama,

953
00:21:44 --> 00:21:46
 wait. At least take this ten

954
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
 rupees. Purchase some second-hand

955
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
 chappal.

956
00:21:50 --> 00:21:52
 He should give it or not?

957
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
 No, not a single rupee he gave.

958
00:21:54 --> 00:21:56
 He also

959
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
 started again working with that bare

960
00:21:58 --> 00:22:00
 foot, feet.

961
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
 And

962
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
 as long as

963
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
 he was going to his house,

964
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
 Krishna, he had the miraculous powers.

965
00:22:08 --> 00:22:10
 He is observing the mind of

966
00:22:10 --> 00:22:12
 Sudama. Whether

967
00:22:12 --> 00:22:14
 somewhere, that fellow,

968
00:22:14 --> 00:22:16
 he has wept

969
00:22:16 --> 00:22:18
 seeing my feet while

970
00:22:18 --> 00:22:20
 washing the feet.

971
00:22:20 --> 00:22:22
 And when I am coming,

972
00:22:22 --> 00:22:24
 one rupee he has not given.

973
00:22:24 --> 00:22:26
 He acted like

974
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
 Hollywood hero.

975
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
 Acting?

976
00:22:30 --> 00:22:32
 Unseen matter.

977
00:22:32 --> 00:22:34
 Now one rupee he has not given.

978
00:22:34 --> 00:22:36
 Like that, whether he will

979
00:22:36 --> 00:22:38
 stay in his mind, he was observing

980
00:22:38 --> 00:22:40
 his mind.

981
00:22:40 --> 00:22:42
 He has capacity, you know.

982
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
 Omnipotent, omnipotent.

983
00:22:44 --> 00:22:46
 Till

984
00:22:46 --> 00:22:48
 he went near to his house,

985
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
 the house remained like

986
00:22:50 --> 00:22:52
 that only.

987
00:22:52 --> 00:22:54
 Just when he is approaching his

988
00:22:54 --> 00:22:56
 house, he bent his head and

989
00:22:56 --> 00:22:58
 he is approaching his house.

990
00:22:58 --> 00:23:00
 Then suddenly, now he will not

991
00:23:00 --> 00:23:02
 scold Krishna. He decided

992
00:23:02 --> 00:23:04
 Krishna. At that

993
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
 moment, he changed his

994
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
 thinking. The house became a

995
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
 big palace.

996
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
 It was not turned immediately.

997
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
 He waited

998
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
 till he reached in the house,

999
00:23:16 --> 00:23:18
 whether he will scold me once or not.

1000
00:23:18 --> 00:23:20
 If he had his

1001
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
 scolder once, his house will remain

1002
00:23:22 --> 00:23:24
 like that also.

1003
00:23:24 --> 00:23:36
 Any question?

1004
00:23:36 --> 00:23:38
 Swamiji, Namaskaram Swamiji.

1005
00:23:38 --> 00:23:40
 Few minutes back you answered

1006
00:23:40 --> 00:23:42
 about not having the revengeable

1007
00:23:42 --> 00:23:44
 attitude when someone cheats us.

1008
00:23:44 --> 00:23:46
 So, let us take one example.

1009
00:23:46 --> 00:23:48
 If someone cheats me by stealing some money,

1010
00:23:48 --> 00:23:50
 so, if I

1011
00:23:50 --> 00:23:52
 file a complaint in police,

1012
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
 is that also a revengeable attitude

1013
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56
 or is it justified? No, that is not

1014
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
 a revengeable attitude because

1015
00:23:58 --> 00:24:00
 you don't know whether it is a retarded case

1016
00:24:00 --> 00:24:02
 or a fresh case.

1017
00:24:02 --> 00:24:04
 Okay?

1018
00:24:04 --> 00:24:06
 So, there

1019
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
 when I have taken the case of

1020
00:24:08 --> 00:24:10
 Draupadi,

1021
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
 that situation is completely different.

1022
00:24:12 --> 00:24:14
 She cannot fight by filing

1023
00:24:14 --> 00:24:16
 case in court

1024
00:24:16 --> 00:24:18
 because it was

1025
00:24:18 --> 00:24:20
 the king, Guryasana was the king.

1026
00:24:20 --> 00:24:22
 Is it not?

1027
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
 So,

1028
00:24:24 --> 00:24:26
 what I tell

1029
00:24:26 --> 00:24:28
 is the case,

1030
00:24:28 --> 00:24:30
 the circumstances

1031
00:24:30 --> 00:24:32
 in which

1032
00:24:32 --> 00:24:34
 you cannot do anything,

1033
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
 any reaction, you cannot, you are unable

1034
00:24:36 --> 00:24:38
 to take any reaction.

1035
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
 Very big fellow.

1036
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
 You cannot fight with him.

1037
00:24:46 --> 00:24:48
 Similarly, you see compare

1038
00:24:48 --> 00:24:50
 Draupadi and Duryodhana.

1039
00:24:50 --> 00:24:52
 They are very powerful.

1040
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
 She is lady.

1041
00:24:54 --> 00:24:56
 She cannot fight.

1042
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
 So, that

1043
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
 circumstances are like that.

1044
00:25:00 --> 00:25:02
 If there is anything

1045
00:25:02 --> 00:25:04
 to be that you can do,

1046
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
 you do it. But sometimes,

1047
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
 that fellow may be very big

1048
00:25:08 --> 00:25:10
 rowdy. He may

1049
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
 say, if you go to police station or

1050
00:25:12 --> 00:25:14
 court, you will be finished.

1051
00:25:14 --> 00:25:18
 Then you will not go.

1052
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
 Then what to do?

1053
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
 Okay?

1054
00:25:22 --> 00:25:26
 One more question.

1055
00:25:26 --> 00:25:28
 That same question,

1056
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
 Swamiji.

1057
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
 But we will be having

1058
00:25:32 --> 00:25:34
 like a pain or like hurt

1059
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
 like that person has did

1060
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
 these things with me.

1061
00:25:38 --> 00:25:40
 So, we were very suffering from

1062
00:25:40 --> 00:25:42
 those pain, not that

1063
00:25:42 --> 00:25:44
 person who has done

1064
00:25:44 --> 00:25:46
 cheating and all.

1065
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50
 See, if you can

1066
00:25:50 --> 00:25:52
 fight, you fight out.

1067
00:25:52 --> 00:26:00
 If you are cheated by somebody

1068
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
 and if there is provision for you to

1069
00:26:04 --> 00:26:06
 fight, you fight.

1070
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
 That is not wrong.

1071
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
 Suppose,

1072
00:26:12 --> 00:26:14
 there is no provision to fight.

1073
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
 Suppose, that fellow is

1074
00:26:16 --> 00:26:18
 very powerful.

1075
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
 You are not so much powerful. Suppose, he

1076
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
 says, if you fight, I will kill you.

1077
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
 And we are encouraged also, you found

1078
00:26:26 --> 00:26:28
 that he is capable of doing

1079
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
 that.

1080
00:26:30 --> 00:26:32
 In those circumstances, I told

1081
00:26:32 --> 00:26:34
 like this.

1082
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
 But if you are able to fight

1083
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
 it,

1084
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
 and you are not

1085
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
 fighting, you are sitting like Arjuna in the

1086
00:26:42 --> 00:26:44
 Kurukshetra war,

1087
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46
 what Krishna told to Arjuna?

1088
00:26:46 --> 00:26:48
 You fight.

1089
00:26:48 --> 00:26:50
 See, you have got some army,

1090
00:26:50 --> 00:26:52
 they have got some army,

1091
00:26:52 --> 00:26:54
 he came to the war

1092
00:26:54 --> 00:26:56
 to fight,

1093
00:26:56 --> 00:26:58
 then you fight.

1094
00:26:58 --> 00:27:00
 He did not say,

1095
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
 go, go back.

1096
00:27:02 --> 00:27:04
 Everything

1097
00:27:04 --> 00:27:06
 throw on God and keep

1098
00:27:06 --> 00:27:08
 silent.

1099
00:27:08 --> 00:27:10
 He did not

1100
00:27:10 --> 00:27:12
 tell like that.

1101
00:27:12 --> 00:27:14
 Hello?

1102
00:27:14 --> 00:27:22
 Ok?

1103
00:27:22 --> 00:27:24
 See, if you have

1104
00:27:24 --> 00:27:26
 provision to fight, if you have

1105
00:27:26 --> 00:27:28
 chance to fight, you must fight.

1106
00:27:28 --> 00:27:34
 If there is no such provision,

1107
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
 if the enemy is very strong,

1108
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
 and suppose

1109
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
 threatens that he will kill you,

1110
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
 and on enquiry he also

1111
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
 found that he is capable

1112
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
 of such things,

1113
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
 then you

1114
00:27:48 --> 00:27:50
 approach God.

1115
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
 Not about me, then

1116
00:27:52 --> 00:27:54
 what about then in relations

1117
00:27:54 --> 00:27:56
 kind of, like how

1118
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
 where we can fight,

1119
00:27:58 --> 00:28:00
 like if that person did

1120
00:28:00 --> 00:28:02
 this with us, then?

1121
00:28:02 --> 00:28:04
 What relation you mean?

1122
00:28:04 --> 00:28:06
 See, when he has cheated

1123
00:28:06 --> 00:28:08
 you, when he has

1124
00:28:08 --> 00:28:10
 cheated you, what type of

1125
00:28:10 --> 00:28:12
 relationship you can have with him?

1126
00:28:12 --> 00:28:14
 No relation.

1127
00:28:14 --> 00:28:18
 You should cut off all your relations.

1128
00:28:18 --> 00:28:24
 He is a cheat.

1129
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
 He has cheated you.

1130
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
 If you maintain

1131
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
 another relationship, he will again cheat you.

1132
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
 See,

1133
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 when you are cooking

1134
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
 the food rice, you take

1135
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
 one grain

1136
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
 and press it, whether it is

1137
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
 cooked or not. Is it not?

1138
00:28:44 --> 00:28:46
 So, one

1139
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
 example is sufficient.

1140
00:28:48 --> 00:28:52
 The entire rice is

1141
00:28:52 --> 00:28:54
 represented by that one grain.

1142
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
 His entire life is represented

1143
00:28:58 --> 00:29:00
 by that one example.

1144
00:29:00 --> 00:29:02
 That is one example.

1145
00:29:02 --> 00:29:10
 Padanamaskaram Swami.

1146
00:29:10 --> 00:29:12
 Is wanting liberation

1147
00:29:12 --> 00:29:14
 an act of aspiration, though it is

1148
00:29:14 --> 00:29:16
 not worldly? As long as

1149
00:29:16 --> 00:29:18
 God is a fruit at the end,

1150
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
 you would be aspiring to reach Him.

1151
00:29:20 --> 00:29:22
 So, how should we approach God, Swami?

1152
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
 A new history.

1153
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
 So, is wanting

1154
00:29:26 --> 00:29:28
 liberation an act of

1155
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
 aspiration, though it is not worldly?

1156
00:29:30 --> 00:29:32
 As long as God is the fruit

1157
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
 at the end, we would be aspiring

1158
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
 to reach Him. So, how

1159
00:29:36 --> 00:29:38
 should we approach God, Swami?

1160
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
 See, you are talking

1161
00:29:40 --> 00:29:42
 about liberation

1162
00:29:42 --> 00:29:44
 and reaching

1163
00:29:44 --> 00:29:46
 God.

1164
00:29:46 --> 00:29:48
 Is it not?

1165
00:29:48 --> 00:29:50
 Attachment to God

1166
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
 and detachment from liberation

1167
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
 means detachment from

1168
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
 worldly bonds.

1169
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
 Detachment from worldly

1170
00:29:58 --> 00:30:00
 and attachment to God.

1171
00:30:00 --> 00:00:03
 Here they are very much related.

1172
00:00:03 --> 00:00:11
 Unless you attach to God, you cannot liberate yourself from the variety.

1173
00:00:11 --> 00:00:20
 If you want to have some detachment from something, you must attach yourself to some other thing.

1174
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
 Then the detachment will be spontaneous.

1175
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
 Automatically you will be detached.

1176
00:00:26 --> 00:00:32
 Suppose you are sitting in the cinema hall, seeing the cinema, you are very much absorbed

1177
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
 in the cinema.

1178
00:00:33 --> 00:00:40
 You are very much attached to the cinema story.

1179
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
 Now the mosquitoes are biting.

1180
00:00:44 --> 00:00:50
 The blood bugs of the seat, they are also biting.

1181
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
 You need not try to liberate from mosquitoes and blood bugs.

1182
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
 If you are absorbed in that cinema, you will not mind these bites.

1183
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
 You are automatically liberated.

1184
00:01:05 --> 00:01:13
 So the attachment to God must be the cause for your detachment from the world.

1185
00:01:13 --> 00:01:22
 Without attachment to God, if you liberate from the world, it is the biggest foolishness.

1186
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
 You see, I am drinking divine nectar, amrutam.

1187
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
 I am drinking it.

1188
00:01:30 --> 00:01:36
 Then spontaneously, automatically, I want to drink coffee.

1189
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
 Before the taste of amrutam, this is nothing.

1190
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
 I hate it.

1191
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
 I don't take it.

1192
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
 Because of the taste of amrutam.

1193
00:01:46 --> 00:01:52
 Neither you drink amrutam, nor you drink coffee.

1194
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
 You are a fool.

1195
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
 At least if amrutam is not available, let me drink coffee.

1196
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
 Something I have to drink.

1197
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
 That drinking habit is there for this tongue and for the mind.

1198
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
 The mind always wants to drink something.

1199
00:02:08 --> 00:02:13
 The mind always wants to attach itself to something.

1200
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
 That is its inherent nature.

1201
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
 So now you are not attaching yourself to God.

1202
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
 You are also not attaching yourself to the world.

1203
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
 Will the mind keep silent?

1204
00:02:28 --> 00:02:35
 In two or three days, you will have double attachment to the world.

1205
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
 It is not a prerequisite.

1206
00:02:38 --> 00:02:44
 To drink divine nectar, there is no precondition that you should not drink coffee.

1207
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
 It is not a pre-stipulated condition.

1208
00:02:48 --> 00:02:55
 If you drink divine nectar, due to that taste, you automatically, spontaneously leave drinking

1209
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
 coffee.

1210
00:02:56 --> 00:03:01
 Such type of detachment you should get.

1211
00:03:01 --> 00:03:07
 Without drinking divine nectar, you want to leave the coffee.

1212
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
 Two days, three days you will leave.

1213
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
 On fourth day you will drink a bucket of coffee.

1214
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
 It is impossible.

1215
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
 Detachment from the world without attachment to God is impossible and also foolish and

1216
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
 also useless.

1217
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
 What is the use?

1218
00:03:27 --> 00:03:35
 At least if that is not available, you enjoy this.

1219
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
 You leave this.

1220
00:03:36 --> 00:03:37
 You don't enjoy that.

1221
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
 Then you will not be able to enjoy the world.

1222
00:03:38 --> 00:03:52
 So, Moksha, liberation from the worldly bonds, is defined as the liberation from the worldly

1223
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
 bonds due to the attachment to God.

1224
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
 That is very important.

1225
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
 First you must attach to God.

1226
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
 Then you should not try for liberation from worldly bonds.

1227
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
 Automatically it takes place.

1228
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
 It is spontaneous.

1229
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
 It is a spontaneous by-product.

1230
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
 For which you need to try at all.

1231
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
 It is a natural phenomenon.

1232
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
 Naturally you will get detachment.

1233
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
 You drink divine nectar.

1234
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
 Naturally you will be detached from coffee.

1235
00:04:21 --> 00:04:26
 Such a type of liberation is Moksha.

1236
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
 You are not drinking divine nectar.

1237
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
 You are not attached to God.

1238
00:04:31 --> 00:04:36
 You are leaving the worldly bonds.

1239
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
 That is not Moksha at all.

1240
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
 It is only foolishness.

1241
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
 People leave the house and go to forest.

1242
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
 They will come and sit there in meditation.

1243
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
 They will be thinking only worldly things.

1244
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
 Then they will run back.

1245
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
 They will come back to home.

1246
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
 They will not come back.

1247
00:04:55 --> 00:04:56
 They will run.

1248
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
 Run back.

1249
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
 Run back to the home.

1250
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
 Understand?

1251
00:05:01 --> 00:05:19
 Swamiji, I have a question regarding food burning in rituals.

1252
00:05:19 --> 00:05:24
 So what I personally saw, there are three rituals that I want to explain.

1253
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
 One is in the 10th ritual.

1254
00:05:27 --> 00:05:33
 They put the rice in a mud pot and they put some kowdung in it.

1255
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
 Raw rice and put kowdung in it.

1256
00:05:36 --> 00:05:43
 They take the dead body along with that pot and cremate it.

1257
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
 Regarding that one death ritual Swamiji.

1258
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
 The other one is with the tarpanam.

1259
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
 Kanda Rishan Tarpanam and the Pudhra Pudhra.

1260
00:05:54 --> 00:05:59
 They have black sesame seeds and raw rice mixed.

1261
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
 We put in water and we do tarpanam.

1262
00:06:02 --> 00:06:09
 That rice and seeds should be thrown in a place where it can't be grown back.

1263
00:06:09 --> 00:06:14
 That instruction has been given by elders at my home.

1264
00:06:14 --> 00:06:21
 The third one is having a haven for Samitha Dhanam, for Brahmacharis who have completed

1265
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
 Upanayanam.

1266
00:06:23 --> 00:06:30
 After every Sandhya Mandhanam, Samitha Dhanam is also instructed for Brahmacharis.

1267
00:06:30 --> 00:06:37
 These three rituals, clarifications I need Swamiji.

1268
00:06:37 --> 00:06:48
 You see, there is one shloka in Dharmasastra in the scripture itself.

1269
00:06:48 --> 00:07:00
 When there is a contradiction between Smruti and Shruti Veda.

1270
00:07:00 --> 00:07:07
 You should take only Shruti as the authority, not the Smruti.

1271
00:07:07 --> 00:07:19
 And these traditions which are suggested, these traditions do not have Adharadi, Shruti

1272
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
 or Smruti.

1273
00:07:20 --> 00:07:27
 They just say that our forefathers did like this.

1274
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
 Only Purnachara, Purva Tari Kurta.

1275
00:07:32 --> 00:07:38
 Their strength is only, it was practised by our ancestors.

1276
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
 So there are now three types of Adharadhis.

1277
00:07:41 --> 00:07:48
 One is Veda Adharadi, another is Brahmachastra Adharadi and another is Achara Adharadi.

1278
00:07:48 --> 00:07:55
 This Achara has the least strength.

1279
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
 Shruti is greater than Smruti.

1280
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
 Smruti is greater than Achara.

1281
00:08:00 --> 00:08:08
 Now, when a thing is presented to Smruti, what Smruti says is,

1282
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
 Annam napadhyat shedata gurakam.

1283
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
 You should not waste food under any circumstances.

1284
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
 It is a vratam.

1285
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
 Gurakan means it is very hard, fast food.

1286
00:08:21 --> 00:08:24
 It is very serious food.

1287
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
 That is what Veda says.

1288
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
 Annam napadhyat shedata gurakam.

1289
00:08:31 --> 00:08:36
 The food shall not be wasted at any cost.

1290
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
 That is told by Shruti.

1291
00:08:39 --> 00:08:46
 Now even if you bring some Adharadhi from the secondary scriptures, that is Smruti, Dharmashastras,

1292
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
 it cannot stand.

1293
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
 Because it is not protected to Shruti.

1294
00:08:51 --> 00:08:57
 Now you are bringing Adharadhi from Achara, tradition.

1295
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
 Our forefathers did like that.

1296
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
 So my father told like this to do.

1297
00:09:02 --> 00:09:07
 That has least weakest authority.

1298
00:09:07 --> 00:09:14
 That cannot be Adharadhi because you know Prahalada, he was born in the Demons.

1299
00:09:14 --> 00:09:21
 The traditional Achara is to abuse Vishnu.

1300
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
 And to worship Shiva in the Demons.

1301
00:09:25 --> 00:09:30
 That was the Adharadhi, Achara authority.

1302
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
 Did Prahalada follow it?

1303
00:09:33 --> 00:09:40
 He didn't follow because Achara authority is the least.

1304
00:09:40 --> 00:09:47
 Somebody in the beginning might have added and that error might have been carried by

1305
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
 several generations.

1306
00:09:50 --> 00:09:58
 So therefore all your three examples are contradicted or ruled out by Veda.

1307
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
 Which says Annam na parichachita.

1308
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
 Parichachita means, Pari means completely.

1309
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
 Chachita means destroy.

1310
00:10:09 --> 00:10:14
 You should not destroy the food.

1311
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
 Pari means completely.

1312
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21
 Even a trace of food you shall not destroy.

1313
00:10:21 --> 00:10:30
 Even when you are eating the food, the plate from which you ate the food, the plate should

1314
00:10:30 --> 00:10:35
 be as clean as before serving the meals.

1315
00:10:35 --> 00:10:40
 Before serving the meals the plate is clean.

1316
00:10:40 --> 00:10:45
 Similarly the plate should be clean after you are eating.

1317
00:10:45 --> 00:10:51
 That is the meaning of this Vedic statement.

1318
00:10:51 --> 00:10:56
 And Veda cannot be contradicted even by Dharma Shastras.

1319
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
 Even Smruti cannot contradict Veda.

1320
00:10:59 --> 00:11:05
 If there is a contradiction Smruti shall be left and you should follow only Veda.

1321
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
 That is what Dharma Shastra itself says.

1322
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
 Shruti Smruti Virodhetu Shruti Virodhetu.

1323
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
 Veda is the highest authority.

1324
00:11:14 --> 00:11:24
 So all the examples given by you must not be practised at any cost because it is Vedic

1325
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
 authority.

1326
00:11:25 --> 00:11:26
 Ok?

1327
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
 Ok Swamiji.

1328
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
 Right.

1329
00:11:28 --> 00:11:37
 But you don't quarrel with your parents and all these people.

1330
00:11:37 --> 00:11:42
 At least it will be your marriage is over.

1331
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
 Otherwise you will enter into problems.

1332
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
 Ok Swamiji.

1333
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
 My name is Ravinder Reddy.

1334
00:11:52 --> 00:11:57
 Swami, is there any pre-plan for human beings birth?

1335
00:11:57 --> 00:12:03
 Does the karma occur in the life as it is from previous life?

1336
00:12:03 --> 00:12:09
 Is there any change in karma implementation in the human life?

1337
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
 Can we escape from karma?

1338
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
 There are so many questions if you ask.

1339
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
 I cannot remember one by one you ask.

1340
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
 Ok Swami.

1341
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
 Swami, is there any pre-plan for human beings birth?

1342
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
 Pre-plan can be there.

1343
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
 Everybody has pre-plan.

1344
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
 If you want to do something you plan.

1345
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
 You want to build a house.

1346
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
 You have taken the plan first.

1347
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
 Is it not?

1348
00:12:36 --> 00:12:44
 Pre-planning is an inevitable step for any activity of human being.

1349
00:12:44 --> 00:12:51
 Does the karma occur in the life as it is from previous life?

1350
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
 Does the?

1351
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
 Does the karma occur in the life as it is from previous life?

1352
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
 What do you mean by that?

1353
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
 Tell me.

1354
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
 What does it mean?

1355
00:13:04 --> 00:13:10
 Does the karma occur in the life as it is from previous life?

1356
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
 Does the karma occur in the life as it is from previous life?

1357
00:13:13 --> 00:13:14
 Yes.

1358
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
 See, the rule is,

1359
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
 the rule is,

1360
00:13:20 --> 00:13:26
 when a person dies by leaving this world,

1361
00:13:26 --> 00:13:31
 he goes to heaven and hell.

1362
00:13:31 --> 00:13:36
 He experiences all the good karmas in heaven.

1363
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
 He experiences all the bad karmas in hell.

1364
00:13:40 --> 00:13:47
 So, all karmas are over, right?

1365
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
 How can he be born?

1366
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
 He should be born after the end of the karma, right?

1367
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
 When you experience these karmas,

1368
00:13:57 --> 00:14:02
 there is a trace of karma left.

1369
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
 Because,

1370
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
 when you are taught, you should take a complete mark.

1371
00:14:08 --> 00:14:13
 Otherwise, you cannot give complete encouragement when you are rewarded.

1372
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
 You are rewarded in heaven.

1373
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
 For the good karma you have done.

1374
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
 For the bad karma you have done, you are taught.

1375
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
 For example, if you see the situation in hell,

1376
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
 if you take a complete mark,

1377
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
 you cannot take 100% of it.

1378
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
 If you take 99% of it,

1379
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
 you will get 1% of it left.

1380
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
 If you steal something,

1381
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
 you will be tortured to a third degree in the police station.

1382
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
 If you give it,

1383
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
 he will not be punished for a few days.

1384
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
 But, after a few days,

1385
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
 he will get along with his friends and steal again.

1386
00:14:52 --> 00:14:57
 Because, punishment should always be given in a complete reformation.

1387
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
 Only spiritual knowledge.

1388
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
 As Sadguru said,

1389
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
 only spiritual knowledge will give complete reformation.

1390
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
 So,

1391
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
 how will you be punished for bad karmas in hell?

1392
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
 The police station will give you a punishment for stealing.

1393
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
 There is no difference in that.

1394
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
 Even if he is tortured to a third degree,

1395
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
 after he comes out,

1396
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
 he will be doing nothing for a few months.

1397
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
 But, when he is punished for stealing,

1398
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
 there will be a seed inside.

1399
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
 It will not get burnt completely.

1400
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
 There will be only a seed left.

1401
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
 When the seed is burnt,

1402
00:15:44 --> 00:15:49
 the seed will be burnt again after a long time.

1403
00:15:49 --> 00:15:56
 So, there will be a seed left.

1404
00:15:56 --> 00:16:01
 So, in the olden days,

1405
00:16:01 --> 00:16:06
 there is a connection between the karmas we do now and the ones we do now.

1406
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
 Due to punishment,

1407
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
 the entire karma should be destroyed.

1408
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
 Only a little bit of karma will remain.

1409
00:16:15 --> 00:16:20
 Because, punishment is not the whole karma.

1410
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
 Punishment should be given in a complete reformation.

1411
00:16:24 --> 00:16:29
 Only spiritual knowledge should be given in a complete reformation.

1412
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
 So, due to that,

1413
00:16:32 --> 00:16:38
 the karma will remain in the soul.

1414
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
 The karma will be affected by that.

1415
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
 The new life will come to the soul.

1416
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
 If the karma is zero,

1417
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
 the new life will not come again.

1418
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
 For what purpose?

1419
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
 For the new life.

1420
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
 There is no karma.

1421
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
 So, due to the karma,

1422
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
 the new life will come to the soul.

1423
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
 After karma,

1424
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
 karma will not be the karma,

1425
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
 but the karma will be in the form of a body.

1426
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
 Karma is doing what is called as lying.

1427
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
 The lie is in the form of a body.

1428
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
 The body remains in the form of a body.

1429
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
 The body can be called as karma.

1430
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
 The body is a thought.

1431
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
 The thought is done with the energy of nervousness.

1432
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
 The action is done with physical energy.

1433
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
 We are talking about a place,

1434
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
 physical energy.

1435
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
 There is a thought,

1436
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
 that thought is nervous energy.

1437
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
 Both are energies.

1438
00:17:40 --> 00:17:43
 But the weakest is very powerful.

1439
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
 Because of the weakness,

1440
00:17:45 --> 00:17:48
 thoughts are not taught in the narkam.

1441
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
 If you think of an evil thought,

1442
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
 it will not teach you practicality.

1443
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
 I will call you and give you a warning.

1444
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
 You have done a thought.

1445
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
 Don't touch it.

1446
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
 After doing that thought,

1447
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
 the action will be done.

1448
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
 Practicality will be taught.

1449
00:18:08 --> 00:18:10
 I will give you a warning.

1450
00:18:10 --> 00:18:12
 Because,

1451
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
 if the thought is practically implemented,

1452
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
 then there will be a crime.

1453
00:18:17 --> 00:18:20
 But, nobody is affected by the thought.

1454
00:18:20 --> 00:18:23
 Only you are affected.

1455
00:18:23 --> 00:18:26
 You should not have sleep.

1456
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
 It doesn't affect others.

1457
00:18:28 --> 00:18:31
 So, if there is a wrong thought in you,

1458
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
 you will not be practically punished in the end.

1459
00:18:34 --> 00:18:37
 But, you will be warned severely.

1460
00:18:37 --> 00:18:39
 That is there.

1461
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
 I say, a thought is very dangerous.

1462
00:18:42 --> 00:18:44
 If that thought increases,

1463
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
 it will render into action.

1464
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
 So, you should not be afraid.

1465
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
 You must cut it by thought itself.

1466
00:18:54 --> 00:18:57
 In the stage of thought itself.

1467
00:18:57 --> 00:19:00
 So, there is a relationship between

1468
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
 past karma and present karmas.

1469
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
 Because, the past karma in the form of

1470
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
 quality thought,

1471
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
 exists in the jiva.

1472
00:19:10 --> 00:19:13
 And that provokes to do

1473
00:19:13 --> 00:19:16
 further actions.

1474
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
 So, there is a relationship between

1475
00:19:18 --> 00:19:21
 samaskara, vasana.

1476
00:19:21 --> 00:19:24
 There is nothing but a very subtle form of karma.

1477
00:19:24 --> 00:19:29
 So, that provokes to do

1478
00:19:29 --> 00:19:31
 fresh actions in this.

1479
00:19:31 --> 00:19:34
 So, there is a relationship.

1480
00:19:34 --> 00:19:42
 Namaskaram Swamiji.

1481
00:19:42 --> 00:19:45
 Swamiji, reformation means there is no quality.

1482
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
 Reformation means there is no quality.

1483
00:19:48 --> 00:19:52
 Talk about the soul of the queen.

1484
00:19:52 --> 00:19:55
 In Dravapati case,

1485
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
 Arjun will bring Aswadam.

1486
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
 After her children died,

1487
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
 then Aswadam's

1488
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
 teacher, a son,

1489
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
 her mother is crying

1490
00:20:11 --> 00:20:14
 and they ask her to leave her.

1491
00:20:14 --> 00:20:17
 Then, she will be reformed.

1492
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
 Why did you talk about her?

1493
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
 Why did you talk about her?

1494
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
 She was theoretically,

1495
00:20:27 --> 00:20:29
 she was practically converted

1496
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
 to kill.

1497
00:20:31 --> 00:20:34
 She was provoking her husband

1498
00:20:34 --> 00:20:37
 to do the war,

1499
00:20:37 --> 00:20:40
 to kill Kavaravas.

1500
00:20:40 --> 00:20:43
 Every day she was telling them.

1501
00:20:43 --> 00:20:46
 That is why they were very much provoked.

1502
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
 Her theory

1503
00:20:50 --> 00:20:53
 resulted in the practice

1504
00:20:53 --> 00:20:56
 of her husband.

1505
00:20:56 --> 00:20:59
 So, she is responsible practically.

1506
00:20:59 --> 00:21:05
 As the Lord now told,

1507
00:21:05 --> 00:21:08
 thought you should not neglect thought.

1508
00:21:08 --> 00:21:11
 The thought, by further concentration,

1509
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
 will lead you to action.

1510
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
 Swami ji, you told that

1511
00:21:18 --> 00:21:21
 liberation means attachment to the God

1512
00:21:21 --> 00:21:24
 and through attachment of the God only

1513
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
 we can aim from the world.

1514
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
 Means through devotion like

1515
00:21:30 --> 00:21:33
 singing songs and doing Japa, Tabai

1516
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
 whatever we are doing,

1517
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
 by the grace of you

1518
00:21:39 --> 00:21:42
 you do whatever you want.

1519
00:21:42 --> 00:21:45
 You attach to God

1520
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
 either by songs or by knowledge

1521
00:21:48 --> 00:21:51
 or by practical devotion.

1522
00:21:51 --> 00:21:54
 Whatever you do, whatever suits to you

1523
00:21:54 --> 00:21:57
 you do. But the result is there.

1524
00:21:57 --> 00:22:00
 The result decides the action.

1525
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
 Once we stop

1526
00:22:03 --> 00:22:06
 whatever Japa or knowledge order

1527
00:22:06 --> 00:22:09
 the worldly life like Maya

1528
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
 is 200% strong.

1529
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
 You change the method.

1530
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
 There are so many alternative methods

1531
00:22:19 --> 00:22:22
 to attach to God.

1532
00:22:22 --> 00:22:25
 Whatever suits to your psychology

1533
00:22:25 --> 00:22:28
 you select that method.

1534
00:22:28 --> 00:22:31
 You have to try all the methods.

1535
00:22:31 --> 00:22:34
 Sometimes all the methods

1536
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
 may have partial influence

1537
00:22:37 --> 00:22:41
 but all partial influences added

1538
00:22:41 --> 00:22:44
 may be the total influence.

1539
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
 By using all the methods you may attach to God.

1540
00:22:47 --> 00:22:50
 Though each method

1541
00:22:50 --> 00:22:53
 is influencing you partially only

1542
00:22:53 --> 00:22:56
 but when you use all methods

1543
00:22:56 --> 00:22:59
 all partial influences added

1544
00:22:59 --> 00:23:02
 becomes the total influence.

1545
00:23:02 --> 00:23:05
 Or some method alone may

1546
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
 influence you. Other methods may not influence you at all.

1547
00:23:09 --> 00:23:12
 Then select that method only.

1548
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
 See different souls are there

1549
00:23:15 --> 00:23:18
 with different psychological,

1550
00:23:18 --> 00:23:21
 with different mental setups.

1551
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
 So whatever suits to a specific mental setup

1552
00:23:24 --> 00:23:27
 you select that.

1553
00:23:27 --> 00:23:30
 It may be one method or two methods or three methods

1554
00:23:30 --> 00:23:33
 or may be all methods.

1555
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
 That you have to select.

1556
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
 Questioner- Namaskaram Swami.

1557
00:23:39 --> 00:23:42
 Swami today on Guru Poornima

1558
00:23:42 --> 00:23:45
 today morning I have seen

1559
00:23:45 --> 00:23:48
 Lakshman garu donating 5 lakh rupees

1560
00:23:48 --> 00:23:51
 and JSR Prasad garu donating 2 lakh rupees

1561
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
 to Swami and you also told that

1562
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
 Swamiji- How you came to know? I did not open the cheques.

1563
00:23:57 --> 00:24:00
 I saw Swamiji. Swamiji- We have opened the cheques for you.

1564
00:24:00 --> 00:24:03
 I have seen that.

1565
00:24:03 --> 00:24:06
 Swamiji- Open the cheques.

1566
00:24:06 --> 00:24:09
 I saw Swami. Swamiji- Open the cheques folded.

1567
00:24:09 --> 00:24:12
 Sharma Sir showed me Swami.

1568
00:24:12 --> 00:24:15
 I don't know.

1569
00:24:15 --> 00:24:18
 They gave folded cheques.

1570
00:24:18 --> 00:24:21
 I just kept there folded cheques.

1571
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
 I don't know. I have seen there on the table Swami.

1572
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
 Swamiji- I shall pay you tax? No.

1573
00:24:27 --> 00:24:30
 There is one officer

1574
00:24:30 --> 00:24:33
 Lakshman's wife.

1575
00:24:33 --> 00:24:36
 She is income tax assistant commissioner.

1576
00:24:36 --> 00:24:39
 So she will ask what

1577
00:24:39 --> 00:24:42
 fourth floor you were holding.

1578
00:24:42 --> 00:24:45
 Swamiji- No. Sorry Swami.

1579
00:24:45 --> 00:24:48
 But you also told that karma phala tyaga is the highest.

1580
00:24:48 --> 00:24:51
 And more than karma sanyasa

1581
00:24:51 --> 00:24:54
 also karma phala tyaga is the highest.

1582
00:24:54 --> 00:24:57
 Now

1583
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
 can I say that I should invest more time

1584
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
 in getting a better job and higher job so that

1585
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
 I can earn more and also I can sacrifice more.

1586
00:25:06 --> 00:25:09
 Yes. Correct.

1587
00:25:09 --> 00:25:12
 I am telling it is not the

1588
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
 question of the value

1589
00:25:15 --> 00:25:18
 of the donated item.

1590
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21
 God sees. See when

1591
00:25:21 --> 00:25:24
 Jesus was sitting in church, several rich people came.

1592
00:25:24 --> 00:25:27
 And donated hundreds, thousands of coins.

1593
00:25:27 --> 00:25:30
 One fellow donated hundred coins, another fellow

1594
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
 donated two hundred coins, one fellow donated thousand

1595
00:25:33 --> 00:25:36
 coins. Like that. Is it not?

1596
00:25:36 --> 00:25:39
 One beggar donated only one

1597
00:25:39 --> 00:25:42
 coin. Jesus immediately

1598
00:25:42 --> 00:25:45
 arose and told

1599
00:25:45 --> 00:25:48
 she is the best donor.

1600
00:25:48 --> 00:25:51
 She, her donation is the best

1601
00:25:51 --> 00:25:54
 donation. Because

1602
00:25:54 --> 00:25:57
 the percentage of the donated item in the

1603
00:25:57 --> 00:26:00
 possession of total wealth

1604
00:26:00 --> 00:26:03
 that is seen by God.

1605
00:26:03 --> 00:26:06
 She donated one coin. She don't have

1606
00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
 any more coin. So her sacrifice is

1607
00:26:09 --> 00:26:12
 hundred percent.

1608
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
 Swamiji- Sorry Swami.

1609
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18
 Sorry Swami.

1610
00:26:18 --> 00:26:21
 So her donation

1611
00:26:21 --> 00:26:24
 he rose from the chair and told

1612
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
 that this is the best donor.

1613
00:26:27 --> 00:26:30
 She is the best

1614
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33
 devotee.

1615
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36
 So these people, one fellow might have donated

1616
00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
 thousand coins. He might have donated one lakh

1617
00:26:39 --> 00:26:42
 coins. So one thousand by one lakh.

1618
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
 That is the percentage of sacrifice.

1619
00:26:45 --> 00:26:48
 That gives the value.

1620
00:26:48 --> 00:26:51
 So God doesn't

1621
00:26:51 --> 00:26:54
 see, but if you go to a

1622
00:26:54 --> 00:26:57
 businessman, if you give ten rupees

1623
00:26:57 --> 00:27:00
 he will give one fourth kilo of

1624
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03
 time. If you give twenty rupees

1625
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
 he will give half kilo of time. He is

1626
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
 seeing the value of the

1627
00:27:09 --> 00:27:12
 given item.

1628
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
 That is business devotion.

1629
00:27:15 --> 00:27:18
 But God what he sees

1630
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
 whether the sacrifice, what is the

1631
00:27:21 --> 00:27:24
 he has donated thousand coins.

1632
00:27:24 --> 00:27:27
 Thousand coins, how much he got?

1633
00:27:27 --> 00:27:30
 What is the fraction of this thousand

1634
00:27:30 --> 00:27:33
 in the total possessed by him?

1635
00:27:33 --> 00:27:36
 Is it not?

1636
00:27:36 --> 00:27:39
 So who donated best?

1637
00:27:39 --> 00:27:42
 Only that one coin donor is the best.

1638
00:27:42 --> 00:27:45
 Not the thousand

1639
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
 coins. Is it not?

1640
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
 Sudama donated only three handful

1641
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
 porcelain rice. That also

1642
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
 he took on loan

1643
00:27:57 --> 00:28:00
 from neighbors. When he returned back

1644
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
 Krishna did not give him the porcelain rice.

1645
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
 He did not return.

1646
00:28:06 --> 00:28:09
 Now he is coming home, he has to clear the

1647
00:28:09 --> 00:28:12
 loan.

1648
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
 And he did not criticize Krishna

1649
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
 in mind.

1650
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
 Something marvelous.

1651
00:28:21 --> 00:28:24
 So he gave unimaginable

1652
00:28:24 --> 00:28:27
 wealth to him. Unimaginable.

1653
00:28:27 --> 00:28:30
 Actually he gave

1654
00:28:30 --> 00:28:33
 three handful quantities of

1655
00:28:33 --> 00:28:36
 rice. Krishna took only two handful

1656
00:28:36 --> 00:28:39
 quantities. Third quantity when he was going to

1657
00:28:39 --> 00:28:42
 eat, Rukmini caught. Because if he

1658
00:28:42 --> 00:28:45
 eats the third quantity, Krishna will become

1659
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
 Sudama, Kuchera. All the wealth of

1660
00:28:48 --> 00:28:51
 Krishna. He wanted to give all his wealth to Sudama.

1661
00:28:51 --> 00:28:54
 So he

1662
00:28:54 --> 00:28:57
 you see people may think

1663
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
 that God can be purchased

1664
00:29:00 --> 00:29:03
 by money.

1665
00:29:03 --> 00:29:06
 That is the karma phalatyaaga is not

1666
00:29:06 --> 00:29:09
 God can be purchased by money.

1667
00:29:09 --> 00:29:12
 Karma phalatyaaga is a proof

1668
00:29:12 --> 00:29:15
 of theoretical devotion.

1669
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
 Karma phalatyaaga must be done as a proof

1670
00:29:18 --> 00:29:21
 of theoretical devotion.

1671
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
 It is very clear in the

1672
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
 world of science also.

1673
00:29:27 --> 00:29:30
 Suppose a boy loves a girl.

1674
00:29:30 --> 00:29:33
 Theoretically loving, singing songs,

1675
00:29:33 --> 00:29:36
 praising her, all like that.

1676
00:29:36 --> 00:29:39
 See he should spend

1677
00:29:39 --> 00:29:42
 something from his pocket.

1678
00:29:42 --> 00:29:45
 Then only she will develop some

1679
00:29:45 --> 00:29:48
 confidence.

1680
00:29:48 --> 00:29:51
 Otherwise after marriage also, this fellow

1681
00:29:51 --> 00:29:54
 will not give food. Simply he will go on

1682
00:29:54 --> 00:29:57
 praising me.

1683
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
 Even if

1684
00:30:00 --> 00:00:03
 All the things it is proved.

1685
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
 See, in Telugu there is a saying,

1686
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
 raaka poka lunti bandhutva,

1687
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
 petti posisthe aapetchanu.

1688
00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
 Aapetchanu means real love, true love.

1689
00:00:16 --> 00:00:21
 Petti posisthe, if you do practical sacrifice,

1690
00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
 then aapetchanu, petti posisthe aapetchanu.

1691
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
 Aapetchanu is prema, real love.

1692
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
 If there is real love, he will stand something in your pocket.

1693
00:00:33 --> 00:00:40
 That is true in pravrti.

1694
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
 You need not go upto nimruti.

1695
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
 Even in pravrti it is proved.

1696
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
 Okay?

1697
00:00:47 --> 00:00:53
 So that here, you may say,

1698
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
 no, I don't have that much money,

1699
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
 only little, I have 100 rupees only.

1700
00:00:58 --> 00:01:03
 Now I will earn 1000 rupees and give to God.

1701
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
 Is God in need of your 1000 rupees?

1702
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
 Or 100 rupees?

1703
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
 If you give now 100 rupees, your sacrifice is 100 percent.

1704
00:01:13 --> 00:01:20
 Tomorrow when you give, out of 1000, you give 900 rupees,

1705
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
 it is not 100 percent sacrifice.

1706
00:01:22 --> 00:01:30
 Today by 100 rupees, donating 100 rupees, your sacrifice is 100 percent.

1707
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
 Tomorrow when you see 1000,

1708
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
 last time I gave 100, why should I give 1000?

1709
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
 Okay, 200 I will give, this time.

1710
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
 You will not give 1000.

1711
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
 Once you get more money, you develop more attachment to money.

1712
00:01:49 --> 00:01:54
 Since your income was less, your attachment was less.

1713
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
 That is why you could give 100 rupees.

1714
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
 If you get more money, ambition for money also increases.

1715
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
 Attachment to money also increases.

1716
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
 That is why rich people can never donate.

1717
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
 Only poor people can donate.

1718
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
 Always in this test, poor people succeeded.

1719
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
 No rich man succeeded.

1720
00:02:20 --> 00:02:30
 When Adi Shankara went to the lady house, she was very poor.

1721
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
 Nothing was there.

1722
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
 She searched all the houses.

1723
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
 One small fruit was found.

1724
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
 That small fruit she brought and put in the vessel of Adi Shankara.

1725
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
 Then Adi Shankara was so much pleased.

1726
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
 Everyday he is going for begging.

1727
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
 People are giving some food, some vegetables, something.

1728
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
 But he was not so much pleased.

1729
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
 But this lady, not having anything in the house to eat,

1730
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
 they were fasting for 10 days.

1731
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
 And he searched in the house.

1732
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
 One small fruit was found.

1733
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
 That fruit she brought.

1734
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
 Instead of fasting for 10 days,

1735
00:03:15 --> 00:03:20
 at least that fruit if she eats, some energy will come.

1736
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
 Some citrus fruit.

1737
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
 Amarka fruit.

1738
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
 But she gave to Adi Shankara.

1739
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
 Then seeing that, he told Kankathaara stotra.

1740
00:03:35 --> 00:03:40
 And golden fruits were rained by Goddess Sarjiv.

1741
00:03:40 --> 00:03:46
 Why this lady was so much blessed?

1742
00:03:46 --> 00:03:51
 Other days he was going to several houses.

1743
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
 They are giving some food, some vegetables, some garlands.

1744
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
 They are giving him his lesser.

1745
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
 He did not.

1746
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
 So this is Goddess Sarjiv.

1747
00:04:05 --> 00:04:11
 Whatever they are giving is far far more greater than this small fruit.

1748
00:04:11 --> 00:04:18
 Here why he blessed her with rain of golden fruits?

1749
00:04:18 --> 00:04:23
 Because her sacrifice is 100% sacrifice.

1750
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
 Nothing is there.

1751
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
 Whatever she had, she gave whole.

1752
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
 That is 100% sacrifice.

1753
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
 But other houses they gave some food.

1754
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
 Rest of the food?

1755
00:04:37 --> 00:04:43
 The percentage sacrifice was only 1% or 0.5% or 0.1%.

1756
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
 But here 100% sacrifice.

1757
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
 So in Ramakesha I say 200% sacrifice.

1758
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
 Because he had nothing in the house.

1759
00:04:53 --> 00:05:00
 He went to the neighbors and brought a load to give Krishna.

1760
00:05:00 --> 00:05:07
 If this lady's sacrifice is 100%, his sacrifice is 200%.

1761
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
 On load he brought.

1762
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
 Will everybody give on load?

1763
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
 If I have I will give something.

1764
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
 Or maximum devotion.

1765
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
 Whatever I have I will give.

1766
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
 That is the maximum, limit.

1767
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
 No, even if I don't have, I will go to other houses, beg for load.

1768
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
 And then what is the percentage calculates?

1769
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
 Can anybody calculate the percentage?

1770
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
 Swamiji, load on the gating by your grace only also.

1771
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
 That is the, see that should be a secret.

1772
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
 That should not be opened.

1773
00:05:44 --> 00:05:49
 If that is opened, you see I told you one story.

1774
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
 Grandfather bought and brought a biscuit packet.

1775
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
 To his house, the grandson was there.

1776
00:05:59 --> 00:06:04
 He gave the packet to the daughter-in-law, that is the mother of the grandson.

1777
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
 And told her not to reveal that I bought this packet.

1778
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
 Keep it secret.

1779
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
 Then she took one biscuit and gave to the child, boy.

1780
00:06:17 --> 00:06:24
 Now grandfather, she did not tell that grandfather bought these biscuits.

1781
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
 Now the grandfather went to the child, grandson.

1782
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
 I am feeling hungry.

1783
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
 Give a part of that biscuit.

1784
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
 He asked the grandson.

1785
00:06:35 --> 00:06:40
 Suppose grandson knows that grandfather bought the biscuit packet.

1786
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
 He will immediately give all the biscuits to him.

1787
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
 He will also go to mother and give some three or four biscuits.

1788
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
 I will give to my grandfather.

1789
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
 Because he brought all the biscuits.

1790
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
 He bought 100 biscuits.

1791
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
 Why one biscuit?

1792
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
 Some three or four biscuits he will give.

1793
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
 But that is not true love.

1794
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
 That is only expression of gratefulness.

1795
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
 He has given.

1796
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
 I gave him little.

1797
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
 That is only business.

1798
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
 To and fro.

1799
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
 It is not.

1800
00:07:14 --> 00:07:20
 So that is why he asked the daughter-in-law to keep it secret.

1801
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
 Don't tell that I brought his biscuits.

1802
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
 Now I am asking the biscuits.

1803
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
 If he has true love on me, he will give that biscuit to me.

1804
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
 Then he has true love on me.

1805
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
 That should not be open.

1806
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
 If it is kept a secret, then only the test will be properly done.

1807
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
 Otherwise the gratefulness factor will lengthen.

1808
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
 He will automatically give me biscuits.

1809
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
 He has brought for me 100 biscuits.

1810
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
 Can't I give one biscuit to him?

1811
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
 That is not true love.

1812
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
 He has not brought biscuits to me.

1813
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
 My mother only purchased these biscuits.

1814
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
 But he is my grandfather.

1815
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
 He is asking why not I give this biscuit.

1816
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
 That is the true love.

1817
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
 He came to test my true love.

1818
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
 Not gratefulness.

1819
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
 So to test my true love, that should be kept secret.

1820
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
 He brought all his biscuits.

1821
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
 That should be kept secret.

1822
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
 He is giving everybody.

1823
00:08:29 --> 00:08:35
 Everything, anything, anybody has, is given only by God.

1824
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
 Everybody knows it.

1825
00:08:39 --> 00:08:46
 That should not be, that should not strike his mind in this test.

1826
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
 While testing he hides that also.

1827
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
 It will not strike your mind.

1828
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
 Suppose it strikes your mind.

1829
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
 Suppose he is God.

1830
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
 Let me give.

1831
00:09:02 --> 00:09:08
 Then by his power of Maya, you will start doubting.

1832
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
 Is this fellow God?

1833
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
 Who is begging?

1834
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
 Are you this guy?

1835
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
 He will create Maya.

1836
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
 You will find out that.

1837
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
 Because the true gratefulness is not the test.

1838
00:09:25 --> 00:09:32
 The true love, which is different from gratefulness.

1839
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
 Of course people, nowadays people don't have even that gratefulness.

1840
00:09:38 --> 00:09:41
 That is a different thing.

1841
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
 But the real seriousness of the test will be spoiled.

1842
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
 The truth is always here.

1843
00:09:48 --> 00:09:53
 Then only the real test can take place.

1844
00:09:53 --> 00:10:03
 Swami, I have a question.

1845
00:10:03 --> 00:10:08
 Nowadays the, moreover society is divided based on the caste and religion.

1846
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
 And as a Sadguru you should unite all the people.

1847
00:10:12 --> 00:10:18
 How you can unite all the people based on the caste and religion?

1848
00:10:18 --> 00:10:26
 If I stand for elections, I will unite all the castes and afterwards.

1849
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
 In fact I am trying.

1850
00:10:30 --> 00:10:36
 First I tried to get sympathy from women.

1851
00:10:36 --> 00:10:44
 So you are saying that Gayatri, women are actually doing Gayatri, not men.

1852
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
 And also that Egya is done by female soldiers.

1853
00:10:48 --> 00:10:53
 Because Egya means cooking the food and giving to Vaishwara Ragini of the hungry people.

1854
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
 So that only they are doing.

1855
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
 This is not Egya.

1856
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
 That I have given a lot of arguments.

1857
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
 So I am slowly winning the votes of women first.

1858
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
 You know, 50%

1859
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
 Almost 50% votes.

1860
00:11:08 --> 00:11:13
 Then I am also doing that.

1861
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
 You see even caste system.

1862
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
 I denied the caste system.

1863
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
 I did that work also.

1864
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
 That Gura Karma Vibhavishah.

1865
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
 Caste is not decided by birth.

1866
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
 Caste is decided by the qualities and the deeds.

1867
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
 Chaturvarna Maya Srishtam.

1868
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
 Guna Karma Vibhavishah.

1869
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
 Based on qualities and deeds.

1870
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
 The caste is decided.

1871
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
 I have given examples from Veda.

1872
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
 Sachakrama Jadhara.

1873
00:11:45 --> 00:11:52
 He doesn't know the name of his father.

1874
00:11:52 --> 00:11:59
 And the Gurukula Gautama asked her, who is your father?

1875
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
 I don't know.

1876
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
 I will ask my mother.

1877
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
 I am working in several houses.

1878
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
 I don't know who is your father.

1879
00:12:09 --> 00:12:14
 Then that fellow came and told, proof only.

1880
00:12:14 --> 00:12:20
 My mother tells that she doesn't know to whom I am born.

1881
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
 So I don't know my father's name.

1882
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
 He told the truth.

1883
00:12:27 --> 00:12:37
 Then Gautama, that person who is admitting to the school.

1884
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
 Gautama.

1885
00:12:39 --> 00:12:46
 He told, you must be a Brahmin.

1886
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
 Because you are telling the truth, you must be Brahmin.

1887
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
 Because you are Brahmin, you are telling the truth.

1888
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
 See, there is a difference.

1889
00:12:56 --> 00:13:02
 Because you are telling the truth, whatever caste you may be born.

1890
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
 Because you are telling the truth, you are Brahmin.

1891
00:13:07 --> 00:13:12
 He did not say, you must have been born in Brahmin family.

1892
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
 That is why you are telling the truth.

1893
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
 He did not say like this.

1894
00:13:16 --> 00:13:21
 From the quality, I derive the caste.

1895
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
 Not from the caste I derive the quality.

1896
00:13:24 --> 00:13:30
 I gave that example in my knowledge.

1897
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
 And also another one.

1898
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
 Janashwati.

1899
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
 Janashwati was born as a king.

1900
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
 He is a Kshatriya.

1901
00:13:40 --> 00:13:45
 And says, Raikpa called him as Shudra.

1902
00:13:45 --> 00:13:50
 Because he was always worried mentally.

1903
00:13:50 --> 00:13:55
 Because here he knows the caste of Janashwati that he is Kshatriya.

1904
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
 At least in Sachikabha Javara's case, he doesn't know the caste of Sachikabha Javara.

1905
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
 Here in the case of Janashwati, he is a king, ruling king.

1906
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
 He is born in Kshatriya caste.

1907
00:14:06 --> 00:14:11
 But since he is worried, he calls him Shudra.

1908
00:14:11 --> 00:14:16
 The person who worries is Shudra.

1909
00:14:16 --> 00:14:23
 That does not mean that a boy born in Shudra family will be worried.

1910
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
 That is the conclusion.

1911
00:14:25 --> 00:14:29
 That cannot be concluded here because he knows Janashwati is a Kshatriya.

1912
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
 He is a king.

1913
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
 How can he have two castes?

1914
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
 I know what the caste of Janashwati is.

1915
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
 Now I am calling him Shudra because he is worried.

1916
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
 So from quality, the caste is derived.

1917
00:14:45 --> 00:14:50
 Not from the caste quality is derived.

1918
00:14:50 --> 00:14:55
 See, our people, you see,

1919
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
 Rommaharshan was a pot-maker.

1920
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
 Kumari.

1921
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
 And in Naimisha forest, when sages were doing,

1922
00:15:06 --> 00:15:11
 big yajna was performed in Naimisha area.

1923
00:15:11 --> 00:15:18
 Then all the sages made this Rommaharshana as the head of the sacrifice.

1924
00:15:18 --> 00:15:22
 This pot-maker.

1925
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
 All these are brahmana sages.

1926
00:15:25 --> 00:15:31
 But they made the head of the sacrifice, this Rommaharshana,

1927
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
 who is a pot-maker, Kumari,

1928
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
 he is made the head.

1929
00:15:37 --> 00:15:42
 Then Balarama came.

1930
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
 All stood.

1931
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
 But this Rommaharshana did not stand.

1932
00:15:47 --> 00:15:53
 Because the rule is, the head of the sacrifice shall not stand for anybody.

1933
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
 So that rule he followed.

1934
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
 Then Balarama became angry.

1935
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
 Why these all brahmana sages are standing?

1936
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
 This fellow is pot-maker.

1937
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
 He is not standing, seeing me.

1938
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
 He took the halayas and killed him.

1939
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
 Then all sages scolded Balarama.

1940
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
 In Bhagavatam it is there.

1941
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
 Scolded Balarama.

1942
00:16:16 --> 00:16:21
 Even though he is pot-maker, by his knowledge of Vedas,

1943
00:16:21 --> 00:16:26
 by his parents, by his qualities,

1944
00:16:26 --> 00:16:32
 he is not only brahmana, he is the best brahmana.

1945
00:16:32 --> 00:16:37
 That is why he was made the president of the sacrifice.

1946
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
 You have done wrong thing.

1947
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
 All sages condemned Balarama.

1948
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
 Then Balarama being the incarnation of Adi Shesha,

1949
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
 he gave life to him.

1950
00:16:49 --> 00:16:54
 And asked an excuse, asked Rommaharshana to excuse his sin.

1951
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
 This is in Bhagavatam.

1952
00:16:57 --> 00:17:03
 So, you see, all these nonsense was created

1953
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
 just 5000 years back since Kali age started.

1954
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
 Because Kali wants to split the people.

1955
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
 Quarrel with each other.

1956
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
 Kali, Kali is like this.

1957
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
 The characteristics of Kali is only to split,

1958
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
 create quarrels, create hatred.

1959
00:17:23 --> 00:17:30
 So that I have taken lot of care about these things in my knowledge.

1960
00:17:30 --> 00:17:38
 What is time?

1961
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
 5 o'clock.

1962
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
 Swami, I have got a question.

1963
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
 Yes.

1964
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
 Swami, the proof of the practical devotion is

1965
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
 karma phalachyaga and karma sanjyaga.

1966
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
 So between these two, which one is higher?

1967
00:17:53 --> 00:17:58
 See, in Gita it is clearly told that karma phalachyaga is the highest.

1968
00:17:58 --> 00:18:15
 See, scientifically also explained.

1969
00:18:15 --> 00:18:20
 In karma sanyasa, in doing sacrifice of work,

1970
00:18:20 --> 00:18:23
 energy is sacrificed.

1971
00:18:23 --> 00:18:27
 In karma phalachyaga, sacrifice of matter is there.

1972
00:18:27 --> 00:18:30
 Money, matter.

1973
00:18:30 --> 00:18:36
 Gold, in those days gold, gems, they are the wealth.

1974
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
 Not these rupee notes.

1975
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
 Rupee coins, gold coins.

1976
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
 So between energy and matter,

1977
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
 what is the relationship E is equal to MC square?

1978
00:18:49 --> 00:18:55
 That means lot of energy is equal to small matter.

1979
00:18:55 --> 00:19:00
 Small amount of matter is equal to lot of energy.

1980
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
 So which is more valuable?

1981
00:19:02 --> 00:19:04
 Matter is valuable.

1982
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08
 If that small matter is converted to energy,

1983
00:19:08 --> 00:19:11
 lot of energy, atom bomb, what is there?

1984
00:19:11 --> 00:19:16
 Small one nucleus is broken, how much energy it is releasing?

1985
00:19:16 --> 00:19:26
 So, energy, matter, matter is greater than energy, scientifically.

1986
00:19:26 --> 00:19:36
 And this point is, can be, the answer for this point,

1987
00:19:36 --> 00:19:40
 can be found in pravrutti itself.

1988
00:19:40 --> 00:19:43
 You need not go to nivrutti field.

1989
00:19:43 --> 00:19:48
 Even in our ordinary pravrutti, it is found.

1990
00:19:48 --> 00:19:50
 It can be found.

1991
00:19:50 --> 00:19:57
 So, see employer-employee relationship.

1992
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
 Employee is sacrificing energy, work.

1993
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
 Employer is giving money, matter.

1994
00:20:06 --> 00:20:09
 Who is respecting whom?

1995
00:20:09 --> 00:20:14
 Employee is respecting the employer.

1996
00:20:14 --> 00:20:19
 Employer who gives matter, employee who gives energy.

1997
00:20:19 --> 00:20:25
 There are several people to do the sacrifice of energy.

1998
00:20:25 --> 00:20:29
 Employers are several people are there.

1999
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
 But employers are very less.

2000
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
 Employment is very less.

2001
00:20:33 --> 00:20:36
 Is it time?

2002
00:20:36 --> 00:20:39
 So, keep it all this one side.

2003
00:20:39 --> 00:20:46
 Another side is, in pravrutti itself, you can say,

2004
00:20:46 --> 00:20:52
 somebody is a, he is a very rich man.

2005
00:20:52 --> 00:20:55
 Here the question of capability is there.

2006
00:20:55 --> 00:21:00
 See when it is done, yadha shakti, yadha bhakti.

2007
00:21:00 --> 00:21:05
 As per your capability and as per your devotion,

2008
00:21:05 --> 00:21:08
 whichever is lesser.

2009
00:21:08 --> 00:21:12
 So, in calculating HRA, they do four rules.

2010
00:21:12 --> 00:21:17
 Whichever is the least, for that is the tax.

2011
00:21:17 --> 00:21:21
 You know it.

2012
00:21:21 --> 00:21:26
 Similarly, here suppose you have capability of 100 rupees.

2013
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
 You can donate 100 rupees to me.

2014
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
 You have got that capability.

2015
00:21:30 --> 00:21:33
 But I am such a nasty fellow,

2016
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
 your impression on me is only 10 rupees.

2017
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
 This fellow deserves 10 rupees.

2018
00:21:38 --> 00:21:41
 More than 10 rupees he doesn't deserve.

2019
00:21:41 --> 00:21:44
 You have capacity of 100 rupees.

2020
00:21:44 --> 00:21:47
 But your impression on me, that is bhakti,

2021
00:21:47 --> 00:21:52
 your shakti is 100, but your bhakti on me is only 10.

2022
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
 Between 100 and 10, which is the minimum?

2023
00:21:55 --> 00:21:59
 10 rupees only you should give to me.

2024
00:21:59 --> 00:22:02
 And suppose it is reverse.

2025
00:22:02 --> 00:22:07
 Your capacity is 10, but your impression on me is to give 100.

2026
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
 Even though you have impression to give me 100,

2027
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
 but you don't have capability.

2028
00:22:15 --> 00:22:17
 You have only 10 rupees in your pocket.

2029
00:22:17 --> 00:22:19
 Your capacity is that only.

2030
00:22:19 --> 00:22:21
 Then which is minimum?

2031
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
 Then only 10 rupees.

2032
00:22:24 --> 00:22:29
 Suppose your capacity and shakti and bhakti are equal,

2033
00:22:29 --> 00:22:35
 your capacity is 100, your devotion on me also is 100, you 100.

2034
00:22:35 --> 00:22:40
 Suppose your capacity is 10 and your impression on me also is 10,

2035
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
 you can both donate.

2036
00:22:43 --> 00:22:45
 Four possibilities.

2037
00:22:45 --> 00:22:47
 Is it not?

2038
00:22:47 --> 00:22:49
 So that is the meaning of

2039
00:22:49 --> 00:22:51
 yadha shakti, yadha bhakti,

2040
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
 tubhyamaham, dachshinam, samparare namamaam.

2041
00:22:55 --> 00:23:00
 Yadha shakti, yadha bhakti has these four probabilities.

2042
00:23:00 --> 00:23:04
 You take these four probabilities, you can understand.

2043
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
 Is it not?

2044
00:23:06 --> 00:23:15
 Padanamaskaram Swami.

2045
00:23:15 --> 00:23:19
 And some exceptional rules, exceptional examples are there.

2046
00:23:19 --> 00:23:23
 Satuprastha is an exceptional example.

2047
00:23:23 --> 00:23:26
 In a drawer, he got some floor.

2048
00:23:26 --> 00:23:29
 After one month of fasting,

2049
00:23:29 --> 00:23:33
 he, his wife, his son and the daughter of the four members,

2050
00:23:33 --> 00:23:37
 some floor was obtained after one month of fasting.

2051
00:23:37 --> 00:23:40
 He cooked it, they cooked it,

2052
00:23:40 --> 00:23:42
 and they brought four leaves,

2053
00:23:42 --> 00:23:46
 and four parts they divided, each one shared.

2054
00:23:46 --> 00:23:48
 Then Satuprastha came,

2055
00:23:48 --> 00:23:52
 the guest, the guest.

2056
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
 He asked for some food.

2057
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
 Then that Satuprastha,

2058
00:23:57 --> 00:23:59
 he gave his share to him.

2059
00:23:59 --> 00:24:01
 He ate.

2060
00:24:01 --> 00:24:03
 I am hungry still.

2061
00:24:03 --> 00:24:05
 Then his wife gave her share.

2062
00:24:05 --> 00:24:07
 I am hungry still.

2063
00:24:07 --> 00:24:09
 The son gave his share.

2064
00:24:09 --> 00:24:11
 I am hungry still.

2065
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
 The daughter gave her share.

2066
00:24:13 --> 00:24:16
 All the four parts he took.

2067
00:24:16 --> 00:24:19
 That is an exceptional case.

2068
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
 That is entire 100% fact.

2069
00:24:22 --> 00:24:25
 Just now I told you, Jesus' case.

2070
00:24:25 --> 00:24:27
 That dagger.

2071
00:24:27 --> 00:24:28
 One rupee.

2072
00:24:28 --> 00:24:30
 One rupee, one coin.

2073
00:24:30 --> 00:24:35
 So that these are special exceptional examples.

2074
00:24:35 --> 00:24:39
 Exceptional examples.

2075
00:24:39 --> 00:24:42
 So therefore, what is the question?

2076
00:24:42 --> 00:24:44
 Which is greater?

2077
00:24:44 --> 00:24:48
 See, it is the question of capability.

2078
00:24:48 --> 00:24:53
 Suppose somebody is a multimillionaire.

2079
00:24:53 --> 00:24:55
 He comes to me,

2080
00:24:55 --> 00:24:59
 sits here with lot of devotion,

2081
00:24:59 --> 00:25:01
 goes on pressing my feet.

2082
00:25:01 --> 00:25:04
 Doesn't he want to eat?

2083
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
 He is capable.

2084
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
 That is very important.

2085
00:25:08 --> 00:25:10
 If he is not capable,

2086
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
 even if he gives one paisa,

2087
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15
 that is 100% fact.

2088
00:25:15 --> 00:25:18
 He is capable multimillionaire.

2089
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
 Because he is multimillionaire,

2090
00:25:20 --> 00:25:24
 he cares even for one paisa.

2091
00:25:24 --> 00:25:26
 If he is a poor man,

2092
00:25:26 --> 00:25:29
 he won't care even for 100 rupees note.

2093
00:25:29 --> 00:25:31
 As he becomes rich,

2094
00:25:31 --> 00:25:34
 the greediness increases.

2095
00:25:34 --> 00:25:37
 That is why, even if he gives more,

2096
00:25:37 --> 00:25:41
 the percentage is less only.

2097
00:25:41 --> 00:25:46
 So therefore, here,

2098
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50
 if he is capable of doing Karmasanyasa,

2099
00:25:50 --> 00:25:53
 and does only Karmasanyasa,

2100
00:25:53 --> 00:25:57
 that example we have to take.

2101
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
 That example will reveal the truth.

2102
00:26:02 --> 00:26:08
 If he is not capable of donating, giving Guru Laksana,

2103
00:26:08 --> 00:26:11
 he is only capable of doing Karmasanyasa,

2104
00:26:11 --> 00:26:16
 in that case, that Karmasanyasa is 100% sacrament.

2105
00:26:16 --> 00:26:20
 Whatever he can sacrifice, he will sacrifice it.

2106
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
 That is why it is called Karmasanyasa.

2107
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
 Done to be done by saints.

2108
00:26:27 --> 00:26:30
 Saints cannot do Karmaphalakshara.

2109
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33
 Because he himself is begging for food.

2110
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36
 What Karmaphalakshara he can do?

2111
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
 So, it is called, that Sanyasa word is put in that, Karmasanyasa.

2112
00:26:42 --> 00:26:47
 Actually, the principle behind is that,

2113
00:26:47 --> 00:26:54
 the Karmaphalakshara is a test for the theoretical devotion.

2114
00:26:54 --> 00:26:59
 I am not going to Dhuruti, I am not going to spiritual life.

2115
00:26:59 --> 00:27:02
 I am talking in Dhuruti itself,

2116
00:27:02 --> 00:27:05
 what is life itself?

2117
00:27:05 --> 00:27:08
 You are capable of spending,

2118
00:27:08 --> 00:27:11
 and you don't spend a rupee on me,

2119
00:27:11 --> 00:27:15
 how can I marry you?

2120
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
 She will ask.

2121
00:27:17 --> 00:27:19
 And her argument is correct.

2122
00:27:19 --> 00:27:25
 If you are poor, you are not able to spend on me, I agree.

2123
00:27:25 --> 00:27:27
 That is not all.

2124
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
 You are not greedy.

2125
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
 Now you are not spending.

2126
00:27:31 --> 00:27:35
 But you have lot, but doesn't spend a rupee on me.

2127
00:27:35 --> 00:27:37
 There the question comes.

2128
00:27:37 --> 00:27:39
 Capacity.

2129
00:27:39 --> 00:27:45
 So, this answer for this can be easily found out

2130
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
 in Purodhvarayana life itself.

2131
00:27:48 --> 00:27:52
 You need not come up to spiritual life.

2132
00:27:52 --> 00:27:55
 It is a very common example,

2133
00:27:55 --> 00:27:59
 very common concept, even for Purodhvarayana life.

2134
00:27:59 --> 00:28:03
 There you must add one thing.

2135
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
 You are thinking only Karmaphalakshara.

2136
00:28:06 --> 00:28:11
 Karmaphalakshara, provided he is capable of doing this.

2137
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
 That is the point.

2138
00:28:13 --> 00:28:19
 This is Shakti, this is Bhakti.

2139
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
 As per his capacity, and as per his devotion,

2140
00:28:23 --> 00:28:26
 which are his minimum?

2141
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
 HR is minimum.

2142
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
 Which are his minimum?

2143
00:28:30 --> 00:28:32
 Yes.

2144
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
 If your capacity is 100,

2145
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 but your impression on me is only 10,

2146
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
 then Bhootham.

2147
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
 Shakti is 100, but Bhakti is only 10.

2148
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
 Minimum is 10.

2149
00:28:44 --> 00:28:47
 Shakti is 10, but Bhakti is 100.

2150
00:28:47 --> 00:28:49
 Then also minimum 10.

2151
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
 If your Shakti is 100 and Bhakti is 100,

2152
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
 you both are tallied.

2153
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
 So you will give 100.

2154
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
 If your Shakti is 10 and Bhakti is also 10,

2155
00:29:00 --> 00:29:02
 then 10 minimum.

2156
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
 Both tallied.

2157
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
 That is what major temple, ordinary source.

2158
00:29:08 --> 00:29:11
 Exceptional devotees it is different.

2159
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
 Like Sudama, Satuprastha,

2160
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
 they are exceptional devotees.

2161
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
 Or that lady who gave that fruit,

2162
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
 Amalaka fruit,

2163
00:29:20 --> 00:29:22
 Tuazhi Shankara,

2164
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
 they are all exceptional.

2165
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
 You cannot take them as examples.

2166
00:29:27 --> 00:29:38
 I have one more question regarding...

2167
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
 She told that

2168
00:29:40 --> 00:29:43
 that Latshwant gave 5 lakhs,

2169
00:29:43 --> 00:29:46
 and J.S.R. Prasad gave 2 lakhs.

2170
00:29:46 --> 00:29:48
 You know how many lakhs she gave?

2171
00:29:48 --> 00:29:50
 14 lakhs she gave.

2172
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
 She gave 14 lakhs.

2173
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
 And she is telling,

2174
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
 you are giving 2 lakhs,

2175
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
 what about this?

2176
00:29:58 --> 00:00:04
 He is very cunning.

2177
00:00:04 --> 00:00:13
 Swami, I have a question.

2178
00:00:13 --> 00:00:25
 Swami, Krishna told that Gunakarma is a part of Bhagavad Gita

2179
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
 and you are also condemning that Kali Yuga is not following the rule of Krishna

2180
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
 regarding the classification of caste.

2181
00:00:33 --> 00:00:44
 As per now, since 5000 years, actually society is suffering from wrong classification of caste system.

2182
00:00:44 --> 00:00:50
 But at present it is not suffering. Government rule, as per the government rule, that is changing.

2183
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
 Gunakarma Yuhasah is now the rule of the government.

2184
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
 It's not so. I don't see that, Swami.

2185
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
 No, no, no. In fact, the lower caste are giving the reservations.

2186
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
 Yes, Swami. That is what the problem is.

2187
00:01:02 --> 00:01:11
 So, it is like the problem is, Swami.

2188
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
 Reservations is the problem.

2189
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
 But that is based on Bartholino, Swami.

2190
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
 That is based on Bartholino.

2191
00:01:20 --> 00:01:25
 Based on Bartholino, they are classified as reservation.

2192
00:01:25 --> 00:01:34
 But that is, deciding caste based on Barth, that wrong tradition came from the beginning of Kali Yuga.

2193
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
 So it is still persisting.

2194
00:01:36 --> 00:01:46
 At least based on that, now the bad tradition that started from the beginning of Kali Yuga,

2195
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
 that is not present in the present government.

2196
00:01:49 --> 00:01:54
 Because you are born in upper caste, jobs will be given.

2197
00:01:54 --> 00:02:00
 That is not there. Because you are born in lower caste, you will be job.

2198
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
 That is the government policy.

2199
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
 Is it not?

2200
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
 But your rule is not being followed, no?

2201
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
 My rule will never be followed.

2202
00:02:10 --> 00:02:19
 Because these rules which I have told, they have only told theoretical, not practical.

2203
00:02:19 --> 00:02:24
 See, my rule, whatever I told is the correct rule.

2204
00:02:24 --> 00:02:31
 Let it reach to all the people.

2205
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
 Let them think.

2206
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
 Let them debate.

2207
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
 In future we are expecting.

2208
00:02:39 --> 00:02:48
 Padna Maspara, Swami.

2209
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
 Yes.

2210
00:02:49 --> 00:02:54
 Swami ji, I have one question regarding Karmapalli Tyaga Swami ji.

2211
00:02:54 --> 00:03:06
 Swami ji, just now for a previous question, you told gratefulness to God and love towards God.

2212
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
 They are two different things.

2213
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
 Yes.

2214
00:03:08 --> 00:03:13
 Gratefulness is a seamless devotion.

2215
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
 See, you have given 10 rupees to the shopkeeper.

2216
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
 He has given 1 fourth kilo of tamarind to you.

2217
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
 There is something like business.

2218
00:03:24 --> 00:03:32
 That is, since you have given 10 rupees, the seller can say that since you have given me 10 rupees,

2219
00:03:32 --> 00:03:39
 to express my gratitude, I have treated your 10 rupees as your donation to me, to my shop.

2220
00:03:39 --> 00:03:44
 Now as gratefulness, I am giving 1 fourth kilo of tamarind to you.

2221
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
 See, it suits the business.

2222
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
 Even if you express in different language, the basic business is suited.

2223
00:03:53 --> 00:03:59
 You can say like that there, in the business devotion.

2224
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
 But what is the real love?

2225
00:04:03 --> 00:04:10
 Somebody comes and doesn't give any rupee, you give 1 kilo of tamarind to him.

2226
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
 That is one way traffic.

2227
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
 It is not two way traffic.

2228
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
 Two way traffic is business.

2229
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
 And one way traffic is real love.

2230
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
 True love is always one way traffic.

2231
00:04:27 --> 00:04:31
 You don't expect anything from the other side.

2232
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
 Since you have true real love on him or her, you are giving your donating.

2233
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
 You are not expecting anything in return for your donation.

2234
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
 You have real love on him and his personality and his qualities.

2235
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
 Whatever may be the reason, you have developed some real love.

2236
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
 And hence you are donating.

2237
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
 You are expressing your love in practical form.

2238
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
 Karma Yoga.

2239
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
 That is true karma phalakshya.

2240
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
 Or you are doing some work for him.

2241
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
 That is true karma sanyasa.

2242
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
 You are not expecting anything in return from him.

2243
00:05:12 --> 00:05:20
 Then you don't aspire any fruit in return from God.

2244
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
 Then that is true love.

2245
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
 You see, two-fac...

2246
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
 Fan devotion, you have read it?

2247
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
 My fan devotion?

2248
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
 NTR is the actor.

2249
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
 NTR is the actor.

2250
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
 There is some fan.

2251
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
 Whenever his cinema is released, he is spending from his pocket.

2252
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
 Nothing, no fruit.

2253
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
 The hero doesn't know even his name.

2254
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
 He is not giving anything for this fellow.

2255
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
 And this fellow is not expecting anything from that hero.

2256
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
 Since he has developed a fascination towards his personality that is projected in the cinemas,

2257
00:06:04 --> 00:06:10
 he appears very good, very good person in the cinemas.

2258
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
 Though he is very rude outside.

2259
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
 Projected false personality.

2260
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
 But he is seeing and he is impressed.

2261
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
 Based on that projected personality,

2262
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
 he develops a real love on that personality.

2263
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
 And he is spending from his pocket.

2264
00:06:33 --> 00:06:38
 For all the inauguration functions of his new pictures.

2265
00:06:38 --> 00:06:43
 And moreover, when he dies,

2266
00:06:43 --> 00:06:50
 his family members are taking that dead body to the burial ground and burning it.

2267
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
 Coming to home,

2268
00:06:53 --> 00:06:58
 coming to home and take all the property arranged by him.

2269
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
 This fan did not take a single paisa from that hero.

2270
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
 Even the money he has spent from his pocket,

2271
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
 that was also not paid by that hero.

2272
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
 But when he died, this fellow is burning himself.

2273
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
 Doing suicide.

2274
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
 What a marvelous love it is.

2275
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
 Fan devotion.

2276
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
 See I divided the devotion into four types.

2277
00:07:26 --> 00:07:35
 Prostitution devotion, business devotion, issue devotion, then fan devotion.

2278
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
 Issue devotion is also very good.

2279
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
 Issue devotion and fan devotion are pure love.

2280
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
 Parents. Parents are giving all their property to the children.

2281
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
 See when the parents become old,

2282
00:07:48 --> 00:07:53
 the son is putting the bed in the Varanlal.

2283
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
 You are coughing all night.

2284
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
 Then the parents are scolding him.

2285
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
 You fellow, we have served you from childhood.

2286
00:08:04 --> 00:08:10
 Now since your wife came, you have forgotten us.

2287
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
 Like that they scold him.

2288
00:08:12 --> 00:08:20
 They scold him, but they don't change the name of their son.

2289
00:08:20 --> 00:08:25
 That is also pure love.

2290
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
 Parents love their children.

2291
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
 That is called issue devotion.

2292
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
 Issue will change.

2293
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
 Then next is fan devotion.

2294
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
 Fan devotion is climax devotion.

2295
00:08:36 --> 00:08:41
 So there without any aspiration in return,

2296
00:08:41 --> 00:08:46
 the true love is shown.

2297
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
 When there is aspiration in return,

2298
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
 and there is exchange from both sides,

2299
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
 it is true love traffic,

2300
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
 then it is business devotion.

2301
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
 And the first prostitution devotion,

2302
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
 that is to a large extent in our country.

2303
00:09:05 --> 00:09:12
 If you want a job, that is a practical boon from God.

2304
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
 Read 108 times Hanuman Chalisa.

2305
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
 This is to get devotion.

2306
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
 Nothing 10 paisa he has not spent.

2307
00:09:21 --> 00:09:27
 108 times Hanuman Chalisa, 11 times Vistu Sasana.

2308
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
 Give me a job.

2309
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
 Give me Lathai.

2310
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
 Give me profit in my business.

2311
00:09:35 --> 00:09:41
 For theoretical devotion, practical boon is the exchange.

2312
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
 Prostitution devotion.

2313
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
 What the prostitute is doing?

2314
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
 When her customers come,

2315
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
 she sings songs,

2316
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
 sheds tears, shows love,

2317
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
 all falls in love,

2318
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
 and takes his money.

2319
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
 Money is the practical.

2320
00:10:00 --> 00:10:04
 All the songs is theoretical.

2321
00:10:04 --> 00:10:09
 Exchange of practical boons for theoretical devotion.

2322
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
 That is Veshyabhakti.

2323
00:10:12 --> 00:10:18
 And exchange of practical devotion with practical boons,

2324
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
 that is Vaishya Bhakti.

2325
00:10:20 --> 00:10:25
 So prostitution devotion, business devotion,

2326
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
 issue devotion and fan devotion.

2327
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
 In issue devotion and fan devotion,

2328
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
 there is no aspiration for anything in return.

2329
00:10:34 --> 00:10:39
 So issue devotion and fan devotion,

2330
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
 you must develop towards God.

2331
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
 But how we will develop it?

2332
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
 When we want to go to a temple,

2333
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
 some issue will come to our mind.

2334
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
 Some variety of block books will come to our mind.

2335
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
 Some variety of benefits will come to our mind.

2336
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
 Then you will go to temple.

2337
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
 There we will do practical devotion also.

2338
00:11:02 --> 00:11:07
 But for the sake of variety of benefits,

2339
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
 or solution for the variety of problems.

2340
00:11:09 --> 00:11:16
 If you are doing practical devotion,

2341
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
 to get some practical benefit from God,

2342
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
 that is Vaishya Bhakti, business devotion,

2343
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
 exchange of practical things

2344
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
 for another practical thing.

2345
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
 10 rupees, 1 fourth kilo tamarind.

2346
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
 Both are materials.

2347
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
 Material exchange.

2348
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
 But this, I will sing songs,

2349
00:11:37 --> 00:11:42
 giving money.

2350
00:11:42 --> 00:11:47
 Theoretical devotion, exchange is for practical boons.

2351
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
 These two are not correct.

2352
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
 Only issue devotion

2353
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
 and fan devotion.

2354
00:11:57 --> 00:12:01
 Actually, God Datta, you see,

2355
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
 parents show issue devotion towards issues,

2356
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
 towards their children.

2357
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
 And what God Datta did,

2358
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
 I am Datta, Datta Putra, I am your son.

2359
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
 So she also showed me the devotion,

2360
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
 issue devotion, because I am Datta.

2361
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
 Datta means Datta Putra.

2362
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
 Our people, what they thought, you know,

2363
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
 if we treat him as Datta Putra,

2364
00:12:25 --> 00:12:29
 then in issue devotion,

2365
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
 the parents must give to the son.

2366
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
 Then immediately they changed the plate.

2367
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
 Tomeva mātāśa pīṭhā tomeva.

2368
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
 We are your children.

2369
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
 I am your child.

2370
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
 You are my father and mother.

2371
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
 So give, a reverse.

2372
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
 Then God Datta became mad.

2373
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
 And Tomeva became the one.

2374
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
 She didn't tell it so.

2375
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
 Immediately reverse.

2376
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
 No, no, no, you are not the one Datta Putra.

2377
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
 Datta itself means Datta Putra.

2378
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
 The adopted son is called as Datta.

2379
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
 Auraśa Putra means born,

2380
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
 biologically born.

2381
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
 Purusriva Putra,

2382
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
 Purusriva Putra,

2383
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
 Purusriva Putra,

2384
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
 by artificial,

2385
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
 no, test tube baby,

2386
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
 that is called as Purusriva Putra.

2387
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
 Then Gūrhatpanna,

2388
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
 that is by secretly the wife,

2389
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
 by artificial insemination.

2390
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
 Gūrhatpanna,

2391
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
 Chetrajana,

2392
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
 then Datta, there are ten types of sons.

2393
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
 Out of that, Datta is one name.

2394
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
 Datta means adopted son.

2395
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
 Adopted son also will ask for property.

2396
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
 At least some property.

2397
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
 Nothing to do with that.

2398
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
 Danger for us,

2399
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
 loss for us,

2400
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
 and profit to God.

2401
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
 No, Swamiji, no.

2402
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
 Tomeva Mata is a prithatma.

2403
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
 You are both mother and father.

2404
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
 They thought that if I am mother and some father,

2405
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
 then there may be some problems.

2406
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
 He is alone, Datta.

2407
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
 So you are mother and father.

2408
00:14:17 --> 00:14:23
 So just let give yourself.

2409
00:14:23 --> 00:14:41
 Ashtanga Namaskaram, Swamiji.

2410
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
 You told about sacrifice, right?

2411
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
 Sacrificing 100%,

2412
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
 with the ambition that God will take care

2413
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
 if something happens in the future.

2414
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
 No, no, sacrifice 100%,

2415
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
 he is for an exceptional devotee.

2416
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
 Are you exceptional devotee?

2417
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
 Are you one of the public?

2418
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
 Or not?

2419
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
 You are one of the public.

2420
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
 Then Adha Shakti, Adha Bhakti.

2421
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
 You must save your family.

2422
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
 Your family expenditure.

2423
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
 Your expenditure.

2424
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
 You see, one thing I am telling you.

2425
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
 If the aim of your life is

2426
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
 to serve God,

2427
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
 then the amount you earn

2428
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
 and save for your expenses,

2429
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
 the amount you earn and save

2430
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
 for the expenses of your family,

2431
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
 wife and children,

2432
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
 all these expenses

2433
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
 can be put in the account of God.

2434
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
 So, you must save your family.

2435
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
 All these expenses,

2436
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
 which you are earning

2437
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
 and spending on you and your family,

2438
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
 they can be credited

2439
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
 to the account of God.

2440
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
 That means, all these expenses

2441
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
 are donated to God.

2442
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
 Why?

2443
00:15:49 --> 00:15:51
 Suppose your aim,

2444
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
 life's aim is

2445
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
 to serve God.

2446
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
 For serving God,

2447
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
 you must maintain yourself.

2448
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
 You must be able to

2449
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
 serve God. You must maintain yourself.

2450
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
 And for having good health

2451
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
 and all that, you must have

2452
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
 a home, some family,

2453
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
 wife, etc.

2454
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
 parents.

2455
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
 So, you have to maintain them.

2456
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
 You are maintaining yourself.

2457
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
 You are maintaining your family

2458
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
 for the happiness, so that

2459
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
 the ultimate aim of the life

2460
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
 is only to serve God.

2461
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
 Then all these

2462
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
 maintenance expenses

2463
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
 come under the account of God

2464
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
 and you have donated that to God.

2465
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
 You have spent from that for God.

2466
00:16:35 --> 00:16:43
 There is a reality

2467
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
 in what I say.

2468
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
 There is no cheating, no cunning,

2469
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
 no cheating. Is it not true?

2470
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
 Unless you maintain

2471
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
 your body, unless you maintain

2472
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
 some peace of mind and happiness

2473
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
 of your mind,

2474
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
 how can you serve God?

2475
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
 So, all the expenses,

2476
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
 family expenses, expenses

2477
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
 spent on you,

2478
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
 they all come under

2479
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
 the God's account

2480
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
 and all that amount, totally

2481
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
 you have sacrificed, 100%

2482
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
 sacrificed in that. Only you have done.

2483
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
 Provided you keep

2484
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
 the aim of the life

2485
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
 and God.

2486
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
 Not worry.

2487
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
 Just by that one small thing,

2488
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
 you are getting the

2489
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
 effect of the same.

2490
00:17:31 --> 00:17:39
 No, here also my logic is

2491
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
 my aim is to serve God only.

2492
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
 Not to serve the variant.

2493
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
 But to serve God,

2494
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
 shall I maintain my body or not?

2495
00:17:47 --> 00:17:51
 I am maintaining my body only

2496
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
 to serve God.

2497
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
 I am not maintaining my body for my self-pleasure.

2498
00:17:55 --> 00:17:57
 I am not maintaining

2499
00:17:57 --> 00:17:59
 my body to enjoy worldly pleasures.

2500
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
 That is not my aim.

2501
00:18:01 --> 00:18:03
 My aim is only I am

2502
00:18:03 --> 00:18:05
 maintaining my body to serve God.

2503
00:18:05 --> 00:18:07
 Then all my expenses,

2504
00:18:07 --> 00:18:11
 right expenses.

2505
00:18:11 --> 00:18:17
 All those expenses,

2506
00:18:17 --> 00:18:19
 they come under the account

2507
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
 of God only.

2508
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
 They cannot be

2509
00:18:23 --> 00:18:25
 personal expenses.

2510
00:18:25 --> 00:18:27
 And

2511
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
 suppose I maintain, I spend

2512
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
 I take food and

2513
00:18:31 --> 00:18:33
 see I must have some peace of mind.

2514
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
 If I marry, if there is

2515
00:18:37 --> 00:18:39
 some wife, as soon as

2516
00:18:39 --> 00:18:41
 evening I come to home,

2517
00:18:41 --> 00:18:43
 she will take care of me.

2518
00:18:43 --> 00:18:45
 If I become ill,

2519
00:18:45 --> 00:18:47
 she will serve me.

2520
00:18:47 --> 00:18:49
 Somebody is there

2521
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
 so that I will have peace of mind.

2522
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
 Not only health of the body,

2523
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
 but peace of mind must be also there.

2524
00:18:55 --> 00:18:59
 In my old age,

2525
00:18:59 --> 00:19:01
 my wife also will become old

2526
00:19:01 --> 00:19:03
 and my children will be there too.

2527
00:19:03 --> 00:19:05
 So I have to maintain them.

2528
00:19:05 --> 00:19:07
 I have to maintain my wife,

2529
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
 my children,

2530
00:19:09 --> 00:19:11
 for the sake of my mental peace.

2531
00:19:11 --> 00:19:13
 Because I can serve God only

2532
00:19:13 --> 00:19:15
 with full health

2533
00:19:15 --> 00:19:17
 and also mental peace.

2534
00:19:17 --> 00:19:19
 All this is only

2535
00:19:19 --> 00:19:21
 for the sake, the final

2536
00:19:21 --> 00:19:23
 aim is only to serve God.

2537
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
 All these expenses

2538
00:19:27 --> 00:19:29
 come under the divine expenses,

2539
00:19:29 --> 00:19:31
 spiritual expenses only.

2540
00:19:31 --> 00:19:33
 Not worldly expenses.

2541
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
 Because my ultimate aim

2542
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
 is only to serve God.

2543
00:19:37 --> 00:19:39
 I am not going to

2544
00:19:39 --> 00:19:41
 serve God.

2545
00:19:41 --> 00:19:43
 My intention

2546
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
 is important.

2547
00:19:45 --> 00:19:47
 Intention decides the fruit.

2548
00:19:47 --> 00:19:51
 Not the enough action.

2549
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
 I have told you

2550
00:19:53 --> 00:19:55
 several examples.

2551
00:19:55 --> 00:19:57
 Intention gives the fruit,

2552
00:19:57 --> 00:19:59
 not the enough action.

2553
00:19:59 --> 00:20:01
 I am doing the job, that is enough action.

2554
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
 I am earning,

2555
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
 that is enough.

2556
00:20:05 --> 00:20:07
 My life aim is only to serve God.

2557
00:20:07 --> 00:20:09
 So that I maintain

2558
00:20:09 --> 00:20:11
 my health of body,

2559
00:20:11 --> 00:20:13
 I maintain my peace of mind,

2560
00:20:13 --> 00:20:17
 I take care of my old age,

2561
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
 so that I can serve God

2562
00:20:21 --> 00:20:23
 in the old age also.

2563
00:20:23 --> 00:20:25
 With peaceful mind.

2564
00:20:25 --> 00:20:29
 So in that case,

2565
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
 when all your expenses

2566
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
 are diverted to God,

2567
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
 then you have done 100% sacrifice.

2568
00:20:35 --> 00:20:43
 100% sacrifice you have done.

2569
00:20:43 --> 00:20:45
 Because your ultimate aim is only to serve God.

2570
00:20:45 --> 00:20:49
 Not for your worldly enjoyment.

2571
00:20:49 --> 00:20:53
 All these facilities

2572
00:20:53 --> 00:20:55
 only to give health to your body,

2573
00:20:55 --> 00:20:57
 to give peace to your mind.

2574
00:20:57 --> 00:21:01
 So that ultimately I can serve God.

2575
00:21:01 --> 00:21:05
 These expenses come under

2576
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
 his account only.

2577
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
 Not your account,

2578
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
 personal account.

2579
00:21:11 --> 00:21:13
 There is no personal account.

2580
00:21:13 --> 00:21:15
 There is no personal aim to my life.

2581
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
 Except to serve God.

2582
00:21:17 --> 00:21:21
 If that really you are having that intention,

2583
00:21:21 --> 00:21:23
 not for the sake of expenses you develop.

2584
00:21:23 --> 00:21:27
 Sincerity.

2585
00:21:27 --> 00:21:29
 If you are sincere,

2586
00:21:29 --> 00:21:31
 sincere,

2587
00:21:31 --> 00:21:33
 you are a

2588
00:21:33 --> 00:21:35
 devotee sacrifice 100%.

2589
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
 You are the sattu prastha.

2590
00:21:37 --> 00:21:39
 You are sulama.

2591
00:21:39 --> 00:21:45
 But you must have sincere.

2592
00:21:45 --> 00:21:47
 You must be sincere. You must not play drama.

2593
00:21:47 --> 00:21:51
 If you play drama,

2594
00:21:51 --> 00:21:53
 if God starts playing

2595
00:21:53 --> 00:21:55
 with us the game,

2596
00:21:55 --> 00:21:57
 your address will not be there.

2597
00:21:57 --> 00:21:59
 Always be sincere.

2598
00:21:59 --> 00:22:01
 Be truthful.

2599
00:22:01 --> 00:22:05
 Be innocent before God.

2600
00:22:05 --> 00:22:07
 Don't show your intelligence.

2601
00:22:07 --> 00:22:09
 Don't play with God.

2602
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
 Because you have so many

2603
00:22:13 --> 00:22:17
 lack of nerves in your body.

2604
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
 Some intention, some ill thought

2605
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
 present in some nerve,

2606
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
 you may not be knowing that

2607
00:22:25 --> 00:22:27
 God knows it.

2608
00:22:27 --> 00:22:31
 So never

2609
00:22:31 --> 00:22:33
 attempt to play

2610
00:22:33 --> 00:22:35
 with God.

2611
00:22:35 --> 00:22:37
 Be sincere.

2612
00:22:37 --> 00:22:41
 So this is the best method for

2613
00:22:41 --> 00:22:43
 the average person. You see,

2614
00:22:43 --> 00:22:45
 everybody cannot become sulama.

2615
00:22:45 --> 00:22:47
 Everybody cannot

2616
00:22:47 --> 00:22:49
 become sattu prastha.

2617
00:22:49 --> 00:22:51
 Is it not?

2618
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
 Then after all these expenses

2619
00:22:55 --> 00:22:57
 are over, if something is left

2620
00:22:57 --> 00:22:59
 over, you don't need to go.

2621
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
 If it is extra,

2622
00:23:01 --> 00:23:03
 if it is not spent for this purpose.

2623
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
 That is what in

2624
00:23:07 --> 00:23:09
 Latha Vedam I told.

2625
00:23:09 --> 00:23:11
 I am not asking the

2626
00:23:11 --> 00:23:13
 one rupee you spend for

2627
00:23:13 --> 00:23:15
 your family expenditure.

2628
00:23:15 --> 00:23:17
 I am not asking your one rupee

2629
00:23:17 --> 00:23:19
 which you are saving for your old age.

2630
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
 I am asking

2631
00:23:21 --> 00:23:23
 only your one rupee

2632
00:23:23 --> 00:23:25
 which you are spending on your

2633
00:23:25 --> 00:23:27
 luxuries,

2634
00:23:27 --> 00:23:29
 getting your health spoiled.

2635
00:23:29 --> 00:23:33
 Is it doing any profit to you?

2636
00:23:33 --> 00:23:35
 No. Your health is spoiled.

2637
00:23:35 --> 00:23:39
 Instead of that, stop luxuries.

2638
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
 You will be with good health.

2639
00:23:41 --> 00:23:43
 You are benefited.

2640
00:23:43 --> 00:23:45
 That one rupee you are spending

2641
00:23:45 --> 00:23:47
 on luxuries, donate to me.

2642
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
 I am not giving you health there.

2643
00:23:53 --> 00:23:55
 You yourself are protecting your health.

2644
00:23:55 --> 00:23:57
 Oh God,

2645
00:23:57 --> 00:23:59
 I have given this one rupee. God has

2646
00:23:59 --> 00:24:01
 protected my health. You need nothing.

2647
00:24:01 --> 00:24:03
 You have yourself protected

2648
00:24:03 --> 00:24:05
 by controlling

2649
00:24:05 --> 00:24:07
 your luxuries, wasting

2650
00:24:07 --> 00:24:09
 money in luxuries.

2651
00:24:09 --> 00:24:17
 I don't want the one rupee

2652
00:24:17 --> 00:24:19
 you are spending on your expenses.

2653
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
 Latha Vedam.

2654
00:24:21 --> 00:24:23
 I don't want the one rupee

2655
00:24:23 --> 00:24:25
 you are saving for your old age.

2656
00:24:25 --> 00:24:27
 You don't need

2657
00:24:27 --> 00:24:29
 anything.

2658
00:24:29 --> 00:24:31
 You don't need luxuries.

2659
00:24:31 --> 00:24:33
 You put the one rupee

2660
00:24:33 --> 00:24:35
 in your heart and donate it to me.

2661
00:24:35 --> 00:24:37
 This actor is a great actor.

2662
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
 You put the one rupee in your heart and donate it to me.

2663
00:24:41 --> 00:24:47
 How easy.

2664
00:24:47 --> 00:24:49
 It is wealth

2665
00:24:49 --> 00:24:51
 from waste. There is a project.

2666
00:24:51 --> 00:24:53
 CSI project was there.

2667
00:24:53 --> 00:24:55
 When I was doing my PhD,

2668
00:24:55 --> 00:24:57
 that project was very famous.

2669
00:24:57 --> 00:24:59
 Wealth from waste.

2670
00:24:59 --> 00:25:01
 Here,

2671
00:25:01 --> 00:25:03
 salvation from waste.

2672
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
 Wealth from waste is

2673
00:25:09 --> 00:25:11
 pravruthi project.

2674
00:25:11 --> 00:25:13
 I extend it to nivruthi.

2675
00:25:13 --> 00:25:17
 Very easy method.

2676
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
 Beneficial method.

2677
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
 You are benefited.

2678
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
 You are protecting your health.

2679
00:25:23 --> 00:25:25
 You are happy with your health.

2680
00:25:25 --> 00:25:27
 Health is wealth.

2681
00:25:27 --> 00:25:29
 If health is spoiled,

2682
00:25:29 --> 00:25:31
 what is the use of wealth?

2683
00:25:31 --> 00:25:33
 So many good schemes

2684
00:25:33 --> 00:25:35
 are there.

2685
00:25:35 --> 00:25:37
 So many good schemes

2686
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
 are there.

2687
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
 So many good schemes

2688
00:25:41 --> 00:25:43
 are there.

2689
00:25:43 --> 00:25:45
 You are laughing.

2690
00:25:45 --> 00:25:49
 LIC schemes.

2691
00:25:49 --> 00:25:55
 Dutta bank also.

2692
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
 Dutta bank also.

2693
00:25:57 --> 00:26:01
 Dutta bank.

2694
00:26:01 --> 00:26:03
 Investment schemes.

2695
00:26:03 --> 00:26:05
 Investment schemes.

2696
00:26:05 --> 00:26:09
 See, I told about Dutta bank.

2697
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
 Once she asked,

2698
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
 Dutta bank,

2699
00:26:13 --> 00:26:15
 whatever rupee

2700
00:26:15 --> 00:26:17
 you are giving to me,

2701
00:26:17 --> 00:26:21
 my assistant Karabhairava

2702
00:26:21 --> 00:26:23
 will type it

2703
00:26:23 --> 00:26:25
 and will put in Dutta bank.

2704
00:26:25 --> 00:26:29
 So that whenever you need

2705
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
 in difficulties,

2706
00:26:31 --> 00:26:35
 lot of interest

2707
00:26:35 --> 00:26:37
 is added as the need.

2708
00:26:37 --> 00:26:39
 Suppose you have given me

2709
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
 one rupee.

2710
00:26:41 --> 00:26:43
 You needed one lakh.

2711
00:26:43 --> 00:26:45
 I will give you one lakh.

2712
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
 As per the need.

2713
00:26:47 --> 00:26:49
 Draupadi gave.

2714
00:26:49 --> 00:26:51
 I will not personally use my hand.

2715
00:26:51 --> 00:26:53
 I will see it.

2716
00:26:53 --> 00:26:59
 Don't materialize it.

2717
00:26:59 --> 00:27:01
 Don't materialize it.

2718
00:27:01 --> 00:27:05
 Not only that.

2719
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
 In this life,

2720
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
 you will be safe.

2721
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
 If you have got excess of money,

2722
00:27:11 --> 00:27:13
 you will waste it

2723
00:27:13 --> 00:27:15
 in unnecessary vices

2724
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
 and you will be in troubles.

2725
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
 This Karabhairava

2726
00:27:21 --> 00:27:23
 will keep your one rupee

2727
00:27:23 --> 00:27:25
 in my bank

2728
00:27:25 --> 00:27:27
 and whenever you get

2729
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
 need in the next life,

2730
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
 even in the next life,

2731
00:27:31 --> 00:27:35
 the needed amount will come to you.

2732
00:27:35 --> 00:27:39
 Even in the next life,

2733
00:27:39 --> 00:27:41
 there is no bank

2734
00:27:41 --> 00:27:43
 to which you can say,

2735
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
 I am investing this,

2736
00:27:45 --> 00:27:47
 next life I need.

2737
00:27:47 --> 00:27:49
 Your address is not found

2738
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
 by the bank.

2739
00:27:51 --> 00:27:53
 Like that I speak.

2740
00:27:53 --> 00:27:55
 This is real life.

2741
00:27:55 --> 00:27:57
 This is real life.

2742
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
 This is real life.

2743
00:27:59 --> 00:28:01
 This is real life.

2744
00:28:01 --> 00:28:03
 This is real life.

2745
00:28:03 --> 00:28:05
 You must have real faith first.

2746
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
 Because you think me as a cheat.

2747
00:28:09 --> 00:28:11
 You don't have faith on me.

2748
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
 And all these

2749
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
 things are useless.

2750
00:28:15 --> 00:28:19
 First is confidence.

2751
00:28:19 --> 00:28:21
 First is faith.

2752
00:28:21 --> 00:28:29
 And moreover, Bhad Dutta does not need

2753
00:28:29 --> 00:28:31
 anything from anybody.

2754
00:28:31 --> 00:28:33
 He has enough wealth.

2755
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
 He can create wealth by his will.

2756
00:28:35 --> 00:28:39
 Because these topics

2757
00:28:39 --> 00:28:41
 come in pravrutti,

2758
00:28:41 --> 00:28:43
 see,

2759
00:28:43 --> 00:28:45
 Karma Sanyasa, Karma Falakshaka

2760
00:28:45 --> 00:28:47
 are written in Gita.

2761
00:28:47 --> 00:28:49
 I have not invented that.

2762
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
 Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga.

2763
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
 Karma Yoga consists of Karma Sanyasa

2764
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
 Yoga and Karma Falakshaka.

2765
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
 Karma Sanyasa and Karma Falakshaka

2766
00:28:59 --> 00:29:01
 together are called as Karma Yoga.

2767
00:29:01 --> 00:29:03
 This is in Gita, Bhagavad Gita.

2768
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
 I have not invented.

2769
00:29:05 --> 00:29:07
 I have not discovered.

2770
00:29:07 --> 00:29:09
 And in Vela also

2771
00:29:09 --> 00:29:11
 Dhane Nacchage Naike

2772
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
 Abhurat Tamaamashu

2773
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
 In Vela, it is in Gita.

2774
00:29:15 --> 00:29:19
 And there are practical stories

2775
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
 like Sudhama,

2776
00:29:21 --> 00:29:23
 Satuprastha.

2777
00:29:23 --> 00:29:25
 There are practical stories in Puranas

2778
00:29:25 --> 00:29:27
 related to these concepts.

2779
00:29:27 --> 00:29:31
 So I am only defending

2780
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
 the scripture.

2781
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
 I have not invented

2782
00:29:35 --> 00:29:37
 any concept.

2783
00:29:37 --> 00:29:39
 Of course, I have invented

2784
00:29:39 --> 00:29:41
 some concepts like Gayatri,

2785
00:29:41 --> 00:29:43
 performance of Yajna

2786
00:29:43 --> 00:29:45
 and Vedam is knowledge.

2787
00:29:45 --> 00:29:47
 Mere recitation

2788
00:29:47 --> 00:29:49
 is not the concept.

2789
00:29:49 --> 00:29:51
 Like that, some concepts I have.

2790
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
 But this Karma Falakshaka

2791
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
 is clearly told

2792
00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
 by Krishna.

2793
00:29:57 --> 00:29:59
 So, Yohi Gnana

2794
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
 Vibhyasad

2795
00:30:01 --> 00:00:17
 In the Vedas it is mentioned as Dhana Chyaga.

2796
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
 In Gita this Dhana Chyaga is reformed as Karma Phal Chyaga.

2797
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
 Dhana Chyaga means you may have some ancestral wealth.

2798
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
 You did not earn.

2799
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
 You don't have the money.

2800
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
 You may donate.

2801
00:00:32 --> 00:00:42
 But if you have Karma Phala, hard earned money, I don't want this ancestral wealth.

2802
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
 I want from your Karma Phala.

2803
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
 Because you are more attached to your hard earned money than your ancestral money.

2804
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
 See God competes with the item with which you are most attached.

2805
00:00:57 --> 00:01:03
 Whether you vote for that item or for me.

2806
00:01:03 --> 00:01:04
 That is the Dattapariksha.

2807
00:01:04 --> 00:01:10
 So there is hard earned money, Karma Phala.

2808
00:01:10 --> 00:01:18
 And if you do Chyaga of that Karma Phala, that is the highest test.

2809
00:01:18 --> 00:01:27
 After doing Karma Phala Chyaga, there is no effort left over on your side.

2810
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
 There is full stop.

2811
00:01:29 --> 00:01:36
 Gnana Yoga, knowing the details of Mumbai city.

2812
00:01:36 --> 00:01:41
 Then I developed anxiety and attraction towards Mumbai city.

2813
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
 To see that Mumbai city.

2814
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
 But the theoretical inspiration I developed is Bhakti Yoga.

2815
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
 Then third is Karma Yoga.

2816
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
 Karma Yoga, two steps.

2817
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
 Karma Sanyasa Yoga and Karma Phala Chyaga Yoga.

2818
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
 Karma Sanyasa Yoga, sacrifice of energy.

2819
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
 I walked up to the railway station, sacrificing my energy, physical energy.

2820
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
 That is Karma Sanyasa.

2821
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
 Then I purchased the ticket for Mumbai.

2822
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
 That is Karma Phala Chyaga.

2823
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
 I sat in the train.

2824
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
 What more effort I have to put to see Mumbai city?

2825
00:02:15 --> 00:02:22
 So after Karma Phala Chyaga, there is nothing, no effort is left on your side.

2826
00:02:22 --> 00:02:29
 Chyaga Shantiranantaram, full stop on your side.

2827
00:02:29 --> 00:02:35
 So that is clearly written in Gita.

2828
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
 I must explain it.

2829
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
 Written in the scripture.

2830
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
 After all our names are same.

2831
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
 Krishna, Brahmanyam, Venugopal Krishna.

2832
00:02:47 --> 00:02:52
 I must defend my name.

2833
00:02:52 --> 00:03:03
 So I am only presenting the concepts written in Veda and Gita.

2834
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
 Not my own concept.

2835
00:03:07 --> 00:03:14
 One question.

2836
00:03:14 --> 00:03:34
 While doing Karma Phala Samarpanam to Sadhguru, why this justice should be considered?

2837
00:03:34 --> 00:03:41
 Is really justice should be considered because you told that in farsabhaj it is a nibruti case.

2838
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
 Anything, there is a thorn.

2839
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
 When the thorn falls into the fire, it becomes vibhuti.

2840
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
 When there is such a case, why this justice should be considered?

2841
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
 That is, the thorn falls into the fire, right?

2842
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
 That is said in Gopika Maradhani.

2843
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
 Gopika, their illegal land, their derisional guard.

2844
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
 There are many such cases.

2845
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
 Kamopkantaka Gopika, Bhayamunam Kamsundu.

2846
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
 Several people have reached God in different ways.

2847
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
 And Gopika has reached God in a wrong way.

2848
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
 Which is also correct because you are...

2849
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
 For that I gave you that example.

2850
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
 Thorn is put in fire, it becomes sacred ash.

2851
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
 For that I told.

2852
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
 But it should be fine.

2853
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
 In the place of Krishna, if some other human being is there...

2854
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
 You are the Frenchman, are you?

2855
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
 No, everything you... Don't put on me.

2856
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
 This is the problem with you.

2857
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
 We are talking the concept.

2858
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
 We are discussing the logic of the concept.

2859
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
 Don't drag me.

2860
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
 Sorry.

2861
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
 So, the suppose Krishna is God.

2862
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
 Is it not?

2863
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
 Krishna is God.

2864
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
 For God there cannot be any wrong thing, you know.

2865
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
 Any injustice is not there in His sight.

2866
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
 No lust for God.

2867
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
 And who are the Gopikas?

2868
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
 They are sages.

2869
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
 For millions of births.

2870
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
 They are sages.

2871
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
 They are sages.

2872
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
 And who are the Gopikas?

2873
00:05:25 --> 00:05:26
 They are sages.

2874
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
 For millions of births.

2875
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
 Doing penance for God.

2876
00:05:32 --> 00:05:37
 Even when heavenly dancers like Rambha, Uroosh and Manaka came and danced with them.

2877
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
 They just cursed them.

2878
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
 They ran away.

2879
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
 Do they have lust?

2880
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
 No, they burn the lust.

2881
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
 They burn the lust.

2882
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
 And He is God who is not having the lust.

2883
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
 But Gopikas reach God through lust.

2884
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
 That is the point.

2885
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
 Neither this side lust is there, nor that side lust is there.

2886
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
 What is lust?

2887
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
 Lust is an action.

2888
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
 Kissing, hugging, all these are lust.

2889
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
 Inner actions.

2890
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
 What is intention in Gopikas?

2891
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
 Intention is not hormonal provoked lust.

2892
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
 Oh, Krishna is very beautiful.

2893
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
 So, let me enjoy Him.

2894
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
 Let me hug Him.

2895
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
 That is not the intention.

2896
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
 Krishna is God.

2897
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
 I have devotion.

2898
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
 Then they hug Him.

2899
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
 They kiss Him.

2900
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
 He is asking, what is that happening?

2901
00:06:37 --> 00:06:42
 The hugging and kissing are inner actions.

2902
00:06:42 --> 00:06:49
 And the background of that, the intention is devotion.

2903
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
 I give examples.

2904
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
 Father hugs and kisses his daughter.

2905
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
 It can be done.

2906
00:06:56 --> 00:06:57
 What is that?

2907
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
 Mother can hug her son and kiss.

2908
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
 Brother can kiss his sister, his brother-in-law.

2909
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
 It is there in Ramayana.

2910
00:07:07 --> 00:07:13
 When Rama returned back, she hugged her and kissed her.

2911
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
 That is in Varmiramayana.

2912
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
 So, this hugging and kissing is inner action.

2913
00:07:21 --> 00:07:28
 But her intention is that she is her son.

2914
00:07:28 --> 00:07:32
 What is the background?

2915
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
 Is there hormonal lust in Manas?

2916
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
 No.

2917
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
 Only love and son.

2918
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
 That is the background.

2919
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
 Suppose same hugging and kissing are done by a rowdy in the street.

2920
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
 Same hugging, same action.

2921
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
 But the intention is different.

2922
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
 He has some hormonal lust.

2923
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
 Here intention is different.

2924
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
 There intention is different.

2925
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
 The action is same.

2926
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
 That fellow is getting punishment in hell.

2927
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
 In court also.

2928
00:08:09 --> 00:08:14
 This fellow is not getting punishment in court or in hell also.

2929
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
 Because his intention is different.

2930
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
 Not the inner action.

2931
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
 Inner action has no result.

2932
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
 The intention behind the action gives the fruit.

2933
00:08:26 --> 00:08:35
 So, Govindanath hugged and kissed Krishna due to the devotion to God.

2934
00:08:35 --> 00:08:47
 And a rowdy hugged and kissed some lady on the road with some hormonal lust.

2935
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
 That is the scene.

2936
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
 That is explained by Sage Narada.

2937
00:08:55 --> 00:09:07
 They hugged and kissed Krishna knowing that he is God.

2938
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
 Thinking that he is God, they hugged him.

2939
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
 They know that Krishna is God.

2940
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
 The intention is devotion.

2941
00:09:19 --> 00:09:28
 If the devotion is not there in the hearts of Godgast, that will be a crime.

2942
00:09:28 --> 00:09:33
 The Godgast and Krishna both will be punished in hell.

2943
00:09:33 --> 00:09:46
 These two sutras were written by Sage Narada as an explanation for this rasakali, ruchya, dance.

2944
00:09:46 --> 00:09:52
 Gurudwara dance.

2945
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
 So that is there I told.

2946
00:09:55 --> 00:10:10
 Because he is God, because they have devotion, even the thorn fell in the fire, it becomes a sacred ash.

2947
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
 That you cannot apply to everywhere in Puroorthi.

2948
00:10:15 --> 00:10:22
 Suppose she is not a Godgast, she is not a sage, she is a hardly lady.

2949
00:10:22 --> 00:10:31
 She is married, but she still hugged another human being with hormonal lust.

2950
00:10:31 --> 00:10:36
 Will that example and this example will be same?

2951
00:10:36 --> 00:10:42
 In that example, she will go to hell, he will go to hell.

2952
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
 And you know what is the punishment?

2953
00:10:44 --> 00:10:52
 Red heart, copper statue, both will hug and kiss.

2954
00:10:52 --> 00:11:00
 They will become ashes. Such high temperature.

2955
00:11:00 --> 00:11:14
 So if Krishna is not God, if Gopikas are not sages, and if Gopikas did not hug with devotion to God, it will be an ordinary sin.

2956
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
 Both Krishna and Gopikas will go to hell.

2957
00:11:18 --> 00:11:23
 That was clearly written by Sage Narada, Narada Bhakti Sattva.

2958
00:11:23 --> 00:11:32
 That is ok Swamiji, but the thing is, if by the grace of you only we know that you are the God, then that time why not we...

2959
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
 You don't bring me into the discussion. You are talking about God, you talk about God.

2960
00:11:38 --> 00:11:45
 Because you see, you may be thinking that I am God. You may be thinking, that is your opinion.

2961
00:11:45 --> 00:11:55
 But it cannot be opinion of general. You have to respect the opinion of public and talk.

2962
00:11:55 --> 00:12:01
 If you and I are all over there, you can talk as you like.

2963
00:12:01 --> 00:12:07
 But you cannot talk your opinion when public is there.

2964
00:12:07 --> 00:12:14
 Several times I told this to you. One day there, he told,

2965
00:12:14 --> 00:12:20
 Swami, you came and suppressed Badi King.

2966
00:12:20 --> 00:12:25
 This is going to Kerala government.

2967
00:12:25 --> 00:12:31
 You know, Kerala they respect Badi very much, that Onam festival.

2968
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
 They will send police and they will arrest me.

2969
00:12:37 --> 00:12:47
 You tell, Vamana came, God came in the form of Vamana and suppressed Badi.

2970
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
 Then you can present discussion.

2971
00:12:51 --> 00:12:58
 But God became his gatekeeper. But at the same time suppressed. That is what you asked.

2972
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
 You asked it in third person.

2973
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
 You asked it in first person.

2974
00:13:06 --> 00:13:14
 Swami, if God came in the human form, then by the grace of that God,

2975
00:13:14 --> 00:13:22
 I know that he is the God. Then that time justice should be considered or not?

2976
00:13:22 --> 00:13:30
 See, whatever God did, it can never become injustice.

2977
00:13:30 --> 00:13:37
 It can appear as injustice to you because of your ignorance, your lack of sharp analysis.

2978
00:13:37 --> 00:13:42
 Just now I explained, Govinda has hugged Krishna.

2979
00:13:42 --> 00:13:49
 It is not injustice. Because human action will not be fruit.

2980
00:13:49 --> 00:13:53
 Whenever you do sin, you know in the present law also,

2981
00:13:53 --> 00:13:59
 the person who kills somebody will be given less punishment.

2982
00:13:59 --> 00:14:04
 The person who planned the killing will get more punishment.

2983
00:14:04 --> 00:14:14
 That SI who planned the killing of Indira Gandhi, he was given more punishment.

2984
00:14:14 --> 00:14:21
 And the actual two people who killed, there was a proposal that they should be given lifelong imprisonment.

2985
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25
 There was argument in the court. Because the law says,

2986
00:14:25 --> 00:14:33
 you see, I want to kill you. I gave some money to some two rowdies.

2987
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
 They don't have intention to kill you.

2988
00:14:37 --> 00:14:42
 I have intention to kill you. I gave the money to them.

2989
00:14:42 --> 00:14:51
 They killed you. Since they don't have intention to kill you, they will be given life imprisonment.

2990
00:14:51 --> 00:14:56
 Since I had intention to kill you, I will be hanged to death.

2991
00:14:56 --> 00:15:04
 Intention brings higher punishment. That is in the present law also.

2992
00:15:04 --> 00:15:14
 So whatever the action, the action we perform, the intention and the direction is very important.

2993
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
 Intention is important.

2994
00:15:18 --> 00:15:24
 So he says Vyasa was asked to produce children with the wives of his brother.

2995
00:15:24 --> 00:15:32
 Why all died? It is a royal dynasty. The kingdom must have hails.

2996
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
 The mother Satyavati ordered Sej Vyasa.

2997
00:15:36 --> 00:15:41
 Just like artificial insemination, fertility labs.

2998
00:15:41 --> 00:15:48
 Same thing, that was, experimental equipment was not there. They were doing that.

2999
00:15:48 --> 00:15:53
 Sej Vyasa did not get anything.

3000
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
 Because his intention was not there. Did he by himself,

3001
00:15:57 --> 00:16:02
 Mother, brother's wives died, so let me produce.

3002
00:16:02 --> 00:16:07
 He did not request. Satyavati.

3003
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
 Satyavati called her and ordered him to.

3004
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
 He has no intention. He will not get anything.

3005
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
 Then our children should be free with knowledge.

3006
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
 Because intention is related to awareness.

3007
00:16:26 --> 00:16:31
 And action is related to body. All these things.

3008
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
 Inert things.

3009
00:16:35 --> 00:16:40
 Inert thing cannot give fruit.

3010
00:16:40 --> 00:16:46
 This is inert stand. Can it appreciate my knowledge?

3011
00:16:46 --> 00:16:51
 And put a garland in my neck? No?

3012
00:16:51 --> 00:16:56
 It cannot give fruit. It is inert. You have awareness.

3013
00:16:56 --> 00:17:03
 So you can appreciate my knowledge and put a garland in my neck. Is it not?

3014
00:17:03 --> 00:17:08
 So, sankalpa alone decides the fruit.

3015
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
 Not the karma.

3016
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
 Even though karma is done, it is akarma.

3017
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
 If the action is done by the inert thing, it is not action at all.

3018
00:17:21 --> 00:17:26
 Akarma is a karma.

3019
00:17:26 --> 00:17:31
 If awareness in the case of awareness, even though you have not done the physical action,

3020
00:17:31 --> 00:17:36
 but mentally you are thinking that action, you get the sin.

3021
00:17:36 --> 00:17:41
 Awareness is responsible for the fruit.

3022
00:17:41 --> 00:17:46
 Not the inert matter, but the inert energy.

3023
00:17:46 --> 00:17:57
 Swami, one more question.

3024
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
 So intention gives the fruit, Swami.

3025
00:18:01 --> 00:18:06
 In the case of Karna helping Duryodhana, maybe the intention of Karna is good only to help.

3026
00:18:06 --> 00:18:11
 But Duryodhana is bad, so why does the seed come to the fruit?

3027
00:18:11 --> 00:18:16
 You see, one rupee coin has fallen in the drainage.

3028
00:18:16 --> 00:18:21
 You are trying to pick it up, wash it, put some scent.

3029
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
 All these things are waste because Karna is a demon.

3030
00:18:27 --> 00:18:35
 He is a demon who came through Surya into the womb of Kunti.

3031
00:18:35 --> 00:18:40
 You see, he is a raksha-sa by birth.

3032
00:18:40 --> 00:18:45
 That is why he joined with the raksha-sa.

3033
00:18:45 --> 00:18:50
 Kauravas are demons. All the Kauravas were demons.

3034
00:18:50 --> 00:18:57
 Demon joined with demons. Demon did not join with Pandavas.

3035
00:18:57 --> 00:19:04
 Even he knows that he is the son of Kunti, then also he did not like to come to Pandavas.

3036
00:19:04 --> 00:19:09
 Even though he knows, he told, I know.

3037
00:19:09 --> 00:19:16
 When Krishna took him away and told, you are the son of Kunti, why don't you come to Pandavas side?

3038
00:19:16 --> 00:19:22
 He said, I know that I am the son of Kunti, but I cannot leave Duryodhana.

3039
00:19:22 --> 00:19:27
 That is his samskara, demon samskara.

3040
00:19:27 --> 00:19:37
 He was the person who suggested to Duryodhana to remove the shade of Draupadi.

3041
00:19:37 --> 00:19:42
 He gave the advice. You see Bharatam.

3042
00:19:42 --> 00:19:49
 He was the person who told Duryodhana to invite Draupadi to sit on his lap.

3043
00:19:49 --> 00:19:52
 He suggested.

3044
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
 He told to Duryodhana. He told her also.

3045
00:19:58 --> 00:20:02
 See actually Pandavas are his brothers.

3046
00:20:02 --> 00:20:07
 He told to Draupadi that, already you have married five.

3047
00:20:07 --> 00:20:10
 What is wrong with sixth?

3048
00:20:10 --> 00:20:13
 You married Duryodhana.

3049
00:20:13 --> 00:20:22
 He told to. See, can a human being knowing that they are his blood brothers,

3050
00:20:22 --> 00:20:26
 blood brothers, is not?

3051
00:20:26 --> 00:20:31
 Will any human being say this sentence to Draupadi?

3052
00:20:31 --> 00:20:35
 He told.

3053
00:20:35 --> 00:20:38
 She is defeated. She is our servant.

3054
00:20:38 --> 00:20:41
 We have right to remove her sarees.

3055
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
 Whether she wears a saree or not, how does it matter?

3056
00:20:45 --> 00:20:49
 He suggested.

3057
00:20:49 --> 00:20:53
 See, he got the quality of charity.

3058
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
 Dhanam. Giving practical sacrifice.

3059
00:20:57 --> 00:21:03
 That dhanam he got because he stayed in the globe of sun for a long time.

3060
00:21:03 --> 00:21:05
 Sun is the best donor.

3061
00:21:05 --> 00:21:10
 When he comes, he gives the life energy to all living beings.

3062
00:21:10 --> 00:21:14
 Without expending anything in return.

3063
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
 That charity quality is highest in sun.

3064
00:21:18 --> 00:21:25
 Because he was associated with sun for a long time, he got that quality from sun.

3065
00:21:25 --> 00:21:32
 Since he got that one quality, do we excuse all other demonic qualities?

3066
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
 Suppose somebody is gold ballast.

3067
00:21:36 --> 00:21:41
 He steals some money from some house, some gold jewels.

3068
00:21:41 --> 00:21:44
 Should he be arrested or not?

3069
00:21:44 --> 00:21:48
 He is a gold ballast.

3070
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
 Karna cannot be excused.

3071
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
 Okay.

3072
00:21:56 --> 00:21:59
 Six.

3073
00:21:59 --> 00:22:02
 Six.

3074
00:22:02 --> 00:22:06
 If anybody wants to ask questions, you can ask.

3075
00:22:06 --> 00:22:10
 Swamiji, how we can...

3076
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
 Let her ask.

3077
00:22:13 --> 00:22:17
 Swamiji, how...

3078
00:22:17 --> 00:22:20
 You.

3079
00:22:20 --> 00:22:23
 Namaskaram Swami.

3080
00:22:23 --> 00:22:29
 I have a long-lasting question in my mind for several years.

3081
00:22:29 --> 00:22:37
 In this gigantic universe, our earth planet is very minute.

3082
00:22:37 --> 00:22:44
 What is the significance, existence of human beings and doing karma?

3083
00:22:44 --> 00:22:49
 Is there any profit or loss to the universe?

3084
00:22:49 --> 00:22:56
 Suppose I rush back the same question to you.

3085
00:22:56 --> 00:23:00
 Take another different example.

3086
00:23:00 --> 00:23:03
 JNP University is established.

3087
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
 Some students are studying there.

3088
00:23:07 --> 00:23:11
 Lecturers are coming, teaching the lessons.

3089
00:23:11 --> 00:23:13
 They are doing practicals.

3090
00:23:13 --> 00:23:16
 Then examinations are coming.

3091
00:23:16 --> 00:23:21
 Examiners are coming and conducting tests, examinations.

3092
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
 Then they are passing.

3093
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
 Somebody failing.

3094
00:23:26 --> 00:23:28
 Somebody passing with happiness.

3095
00:23:28 --> 00:23:33
 Somebody failing and committing suicide also sometimes.

3096
00:23:33 --> 00:23:39
 So, what is the use of all this?

3097
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
 To get jobs.

3098
00:23:41 --> 00:23:44
 Okay, to get jobs, what is the use?

3099
00:23:44 --> 00:23:53
 See, the thing is, a systematic system was established by God.

3100
00:23:53 --> 00:23:56
 He created the souls.

3101
00:23:56 --> 00:24:05
 But at the same time, He established a perfect, regular system.

3102
00:24:05 --> 00:24:12
 If you find any fault in His system, you can ask.

3103
00:24:12 --> 00:24:15
 But why all this?

3104
00:24:15 --> 00:24:17
 Why all this means?

3105
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
 You see, somebody, you have a lot of money.

3106
00:24:22 --> 00:24:25
 You have started a college.

3107
00:24:25 --> 00:24:30
 With good intention only you started the college.

3108
00:24:30 --> 00:24:34
 You have appointed very good staff.

3109
00:24:34 --> 00:24:38
 Very good laboratories and equipment you have set up.

3110
00:24:38 --> 00:24:43
 No injustice is done anywhere in the administration of the college.

3111
00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
 Students are admitted.

3112
00:24:46 --> 00:24:54
 They are studying, taking degrees, getting jobs.

3113
00:24:54 --> 00:25:05
 So, in this story, the why has no answer at the end.

3114
00:25:05 --> 00:25:10
 Why they are studying? To get jobs.

3115
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
 Why they are doing jobs?

3116
00:25:12 --> 00:25:17
 To earn something for eating and for...

3117
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
 Why should they eat?

3118
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
 No answer.

3119
00:25:21 --> 00:25:25
 Somewhere, this why will have no answer in the end.

3120
00:25:25 --> 00:25:30
 But everywhere, you can put the question,

3121
00:25:30 --> 00:25:35
 Why He has appointed good lecturers?

3122
00:25:35 --> 00:25:42
 He has appointed good lecturers because the college which you have established should run on perfect justice.

3123
00:25:42 --> 00:25:48
 See, you cannot say that somebody's...

3124
00:25:48 --> 00:25:53
 All the students passed with good results.

3125
00:25:53 --> 00:25:57
 But somebody committed suicide because they have not studied well.

3126
00:25:57 --> 00:26:01
 Suppose, if his father files a case on you in the court.

3127
00:26:01 --> 00:26:06
 Since you started the college, my son got admitted.

3128
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
 And since he failed, he committed suicide.

3129
00:26:11 --> 00:26:15
 Had he not started this college, my son would have not died.

3130
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18
 My son would have not lost his life.

3131
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
 If he attacks like that, will he...

3132
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
 Suppose, you have given the electricity to all the houses.

3133
00:26:26 --> 00:26:30
 My son put his finger there.

3134
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
 Had you not invented this electricity, all the lamps, it would have been alright.

3135
00:26:36 --> 00:26:43
 Since you have... suppose, the electricity department will file a case.

3136
00:26:43 --> 00:26:46
 How many people are using the electricity?

3137
00:26:46 --> 00:26:48
 How many are benefited?

3138
00:26:48 --> 00:26:51
 What about them?

3139
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
 You have started a college for some engagement.

3140
00:26:55 --> 00:26:59
 To engage yourself in some work without sitting idle.

3141
00:26:59 --> 00:27:02
 Now, this father of the boy says,

3142
00:27:02 --> 00:27:10
 Because of your engagement in the work, should my son die?

3143
00:27:10 --> 00:27:18
 I may have my engagement, my entertainment, my engagement in the work is a secondary thing.

3144
00:27:18 --> 00:27:27
 Had I done any mistake in running the college, then I am responsible to answer.

3145
00:27:27 --> 00:27:30
 I did not do any mistake.

3146
00:27:30 --> 00:27:38
 Staff were best, equipment were best, laboratories were best, conducting the examinations were perfectly correct.

3147
00:27:38 --> 00:27:44
 But in spite of all this, why should you start the college?

3148
00:27:44 --> 00:27:51
 Since you will be idle, you have no work, then it will bore you.

3149
00:27:51 --> 00:27:53
 That is why he has started this college.

3150
00:27:53 --> 00:27:56
 And that led to the death of my son.

3151
00:27:56 --> 00:27:57
 He committed suicide.

3152
00:27:57 --> 00:28:00
 Had you not started college, you would have not committed.

3153
00:28:00 --> 00:28:04
 That is not the thing. That is not the answer.

3154
00:28:04 --> 00:28:08
 God created this universe for his entertainment.

3155
00:28:08 --> 00:28:10
 That Veda says,

3156
00:28:10 --> 00:28:15
 Veda itself says that.

3157
00:28:15 --> 00:28:17
 But that is only secondary thing.

3158
00:28:17 --> 00:28:23
 He created and he is running the whole world with perfect administration.

3159
00:28:23 --> 00:28:27
 Nothing, you may think this here injustice happened.

3160
00:28:27 --> 00:28:30
 You don't know the whole story of the Bhaidraud.

3161
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
 You are seeing the jailer hanging him.

3162
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
 And you become angry, this is injustice.

3163
00:28:38 --> 00:28:44
 Those two fellows have killed 60 people.

3164
00:28:44 --> 00:28:46
 That scene you have not seen.

3165
00:28:46 --> 00:28:49
 Only you have seen this scene.

3166
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
 So everywhere God's administration is perfect,

3167
00:28:53 --> 00:29:01
 because of your partial knowledge, partial awareness of the situation, you may criticize God.

3168
00:29:01 --> 00:29:04
 But if you see the whole scene,

3169
00:29:04 --> 00:29:11
 present, past and future, all that you can see, the administration is perfect, alright.

3170
00:29:11 --> 00:29:17
 His entertainment, entertaining the world may be a secondary thing.

3171
00:29:17 --> 00:29:24
 Along with it, if something is enjoyed, it doesn't affect the priority thing.

3172
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
 Suppose you have gone to present a paper in Bombay IIT.

3173
00:29:28 --> 00:29:33
 So you have presented the paper, very well, appreciated everything.

3174
00:29:33 --> 00:29:36
 While coming back, they have given you some money.

3175
00:29:36 --> 00:29:40
 With that money you have purchased a sari for your wife.

3176
00:29:40 --> 00:29:46
 You have gone to Bombay to purchase a sari for your wife.

3177
00:29:46 --> 00:29:48
 That is only secondary thing.

3178
00:29:48 --> 00:29:51
 It does not contradict the priority thing.

3179
00:29:51 --> 00:29:55
 You have gone to the IIT, you have presented the paper, all people appreciated.

3180
00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
 That is the priority thing.

3181
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
 You can criticize about that.

3182
00:30:00 --> 00:00:08
 But while coming to home, you went to shop, you purchased a saree.

3183
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
 Why government has given money?

3184
00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
 Only for your charges.

3185
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
 Why should you purchase a saree?

3186
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
 Even if I purchase a saree, I give the private work.

3187
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
 Very good. That is no fault to it.

3188
00:00:25 --> 00:00:34
 So therefore, if you go on speaking like that, why has no answer at the end?

3189
00:00:34 --> 00:00:39
 Because you continuously will be going.

3190
00:00:39 --> 00:00:52
 It appears as if you see, for his entertainment,

3191
00:00:52 --> 00:00:58
 we shall be in pain, we shall suffer.

3192
00:00:58 --> 00:01:05
 That fellow, if he has no entertainment, let him sleep.

3193
00:01:05 --> 00:01:12
 If he is still awake, he will let him sleep.

3194
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
 Then in Ashram, if he is still awake, he will get up.

3195
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
 Four months only.

3196
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
 What about the rest eight months?

3197
00:01:24 --> 00:01:35
 So anything more? Anybody?

3198
00:01:35 --> 00:01:51
 Padanamaskaram Swami.

3199
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
 Swami, while discussing with Satvika and Kishoranna, we got one question, Swami.

3200
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
 Sometimes in the service of God, even if we do our effort,

3201
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
 if expected output may not come, it causes lot of pain.

3202
00:02:07 --> 00:02:11
 How to overcome this, Swami?

3203
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
 You see, even in the service of God, if you are getting like that,

3204
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
 it means definitely there is ignorance in you.

3205
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
 Only due to your ignorance, you are feeling like that.

3206
00:02:24 --> 00:02:32
 See, the omnipotent, omniscient God, in His service, if you are getting like this,

3207
00:02:32 --> 00:02:37
 then what about the human service and human circumstances?

3208
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
 There may be fault in human. You are working in a hospital.

3209
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
 There is some management. The management may do wrong.

3210
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
 You may get pain. Some injustice may happen. There is possibility there.

3211
00:02:52 --> 00:02:57
 But you are telling directly to God, in His service,

3212
00:02:57 --> 00:03:04
 I am not getting expectation, and I am pained by that.

3213
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
 That means definitely that is your ignorance only.

3214
00:03:08 --> 00:03:13
 Your pain is meaningless. Your idea is wrong.

3215
00:03:13 --> 00:03:20
 Nothing, you see, there cannot be darkness in the sun.

3216
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
 There cannot be darkness in the sunlight.

3217
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
 In His administration, nothing is there.

3218
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
 Suppose you have got your pain. It may be like this also.

3219
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
 You might have prayed to somebody in God's service in your dream.

3220
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
 And actually you have to get lot of pain.

3221
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
 God is giving only little pain because you are doing service to Him.

3222
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
 Like that it may happen.

3223
00:03:50 --> 00:03:55
 So you should not doubt God under any circumstances.

3224
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
 That you make a rigid rule.

3225
00:03:59 --> 00:04:05
 If there is some pain, something, you also asked one question recently.

3226
00:04:05 --> 00:04:11
 Brahmanas are having the knowledge.

3227
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
 Then is it not injustice done to other castes? You asked that.

3228
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
 See, some Malayalee department was there.

3229
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
 The Malayalee department is given duty by the government

3230
00:04:26 --> 00:04:34
 to speak about malaria and to take precautions to prevent malaria.

3231
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
 Everywhere they should take mic and they should preach to the public.

3232
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
 Suppose you say this responsibility is with Malayalee department only.

3233
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
 Government has shown partiality to Malayalee department.

3234
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
 And all of us are, injustice happened to us.

3235
00:04:53 --> 00:04:59
 What they are doing? They are taking mic and telling everything to everyone.

3236
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
 See what Brahmanas are doing?

3237
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
 They are preaching the spiritual knowledge to public from the beginning.

3238
00:05:07 --> 00:05:14
 They have not kept that secret in their house and getting benefits.

3239
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
 Then your question is meaningful.

3240
00:05:16 --> 00:05:25
 But the Brahmana is expected is given duty by God for botha, for prachara, jnana prachara.

3241
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
 That is his duty.

3242
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32
 The malaria department is given some literature.

3243
00:05:32 --> 00:05:37
 At that time itself you are telling, our literature is with you.

3244
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
 So you will take all those case in your house.

3245
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
 Public or not?

3246
00:05:45 --> 00:05:50
 Injustice is done to public.

3247
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
 No, no, no. They are taking that conflict.

3248
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
 They read at least one night. That night they should read.

3249
00:05:58 --> 00:06:03
 Yesterday morning they are coming into the streets.

3250
00:06:03 --> 00:06:08
 Yesterday night you kept in your house only.

3251
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
 What about the last?

3252
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
 Yesterday night itself you took the care in your house while reading the literature.

3253
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
 Yesterday night I did not take care.

3254
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
 Because today part of the leader.

3255
00:06:24 --> 00:06:29
 Then our malaria department will commit suicide.

3256
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
 Yesterday I will commit suicide.

3257
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
 And nothing else can be done.

3258
00:06:35 --> 00:06:41
 So similarly, don't misunderstand everything.

3259
00:06:41 --> 00:06:48
 When you understand, take some time, give some time and you understand it properly.

3260
00:06:48 --> 00:06:55
 Especially in spiritual side there will be no injustice.

3261
00:06:55 --> 00:07:03
 If you do sin, the punishment will be given after some time.

3262
00:07:03 --> 00:07:08
 If I do the sin, on the spot itself I will die.

3263
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
 I will vomit the blood and die on the spot itself.

3264
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
 For you it will take some time.

3265
00:07:16 --> 00:07:23
 So the brahmanas were given that literature to propagate in the public.

3266
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
 And everybody knows the information. Whoever practices it will get the result.

3267
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
 They are not kept in their house.

3268
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
 And used only for their families and houses.

3269
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41
 Because Gyanaprakara is the duty of the brahmanas.

3270
00:07:41 --> 00:07:49
 And to protect the justice from injustice through wars, through fighting, is the duty given to Kshatriyas.

3271
00:07:49 --> 00:07:57
 And for Vaishyas the propagation distribution of the item to all areas.

3272
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02
 One item may be produced in one region.

3273
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
 It should be distributed to all the regions.

3274
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
 That is the duty given to Vaishyas.

3275
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
 And production of the very serious grains is given to Sudras.

3276
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
 All are very important. All the four castes are equal.

3277
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
 All the four professions are noble.

3278
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
 Where is the question of difference?

3279
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
 Difference is there because of difference.

3280
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
 Somebody should be given that duty.

3281
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
 Somebody should be given this duty.

3282
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
 Probability is to somebody.

3283
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
 Treating all are equal.

3284
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
 You do this, you do this, you do this, you do this.

3285
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
 They are even using. Why you are giving that duty to him?

3286
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
 I mean somebody I have to give.

3287
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
 Probability is equal.

3288
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
 Yes, probability theory.

3289
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
 Theory of probability.

3290
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
 It is random.

3291
00:08:54 --> 00:09:02
 So therefore, everything you see, he is producing by agriculture.

3292
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
 Is it not distributed to all public?

3293
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
 Yes.

3294
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
 He is distributing all the products in all regions.

3295
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
 Is it not benefiting all people?

3296
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
 Yes.

3297
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
 And that fellow is fighting injustice anywhere, found.

3298
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
 Is it not safety for all the people?

3299
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
 Yes.

3300
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
 And he is propagating the spiritual knowledge for all the people.

3301
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
 Is it not benefiting all the people?

3302
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
 Yes.

3303
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
 You are not following it.

3304
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
 And you are doing in Malay department.

3305
00:09:31 --> 00:09:37
 See they say, they are telling clearly, don't put open water.

3306
00:09:37 --> 00:09:42
 If you put open water, the mosquitoes will breed.

3307
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
 Always cover the water with some plate or some cloth.

3308
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
 That he is telling to everybody.

3309
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
 Due to laziness, you have not put the plate.

3310
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
 And the mosquito breeding was there.

3311
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
 And you got malaria.

3312
00:10:00 --> 00:10:04
 You fellows, Malay department fellows.

3313
00:10:04 --> 00:10:09
 They have already given instructions in the mike.

3314
00:10:09 --> 00:10:16
 Every caste is given a duty which benefits all the public.

3315
00:10:16 --> 00:10:21
 See they say, Ashotra is born from the feet.

3316
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
 See from the feet, river Ganga is born.

3317
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
 Which removes all the sins.

3318
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
 Even Brahmana cannot do that.

3319
00:10:32 --> 00:10:37
 To remove the sins, he has to perform long puja.

3320
00:10:37 --> 00:10:43
 But Ganga river if you take dip, all the sins go.

3321
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
 That is born from the feet.

3322
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
 And she is the sister of Nidra.

3323
00:10:50 --> 00:10:55
 They are brothers of Ganga.

3324
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
 This is not.

3325
00:10:57 --> 00:11:05
 Feet means suppose somebody crush the feet, will he be able to walk?

3326
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
 So difference, only difference exists.

3327
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
 But not low and high.

3328
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
 Hierarchy is not there.

3329
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
 Hierarchy is not there.

3330
00:11:16 --> 00:11:22
 All this nonsense developed from the beginning of Kali age.

3331
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
 Because Kali is spirits.

3332
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
 Introduces squirrels.

3333
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
 Kali wants squirrels.

3334
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
 Kali wants hatred.

3335
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
 Kali wants fighting.

3336
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
 That is influence of Kali.

3337
00:11:36 --> 00:11:42
 Hello.

3338
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
 Hello.

3339
00:11:45 --> 00:11:55
 What is the difference between Dattapareesha, Vishnopareesha and Rudraparesha?

3340
00:11:55 --> 00:12:01
 No, Brahmapareesha, Vishnopareesha and Rudraparesha.

3341
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
 These we are called as Dattapareesha.

3342
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
 Tell me.

3343
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
 What is the difference you want?

3344
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
 Is it not?

3345
00:12:11 --> 00:12:22
 See Brahmapareesha means that if God appears and you ask some boon from him, he expects

3346
00:12:22 --> 00:12:23
 some boon from him.

3347
00:12:23 --> 00:12:30
 He will not give the boon, he will just disappear.

3348
00:12:30 --> 00:12:35
 Then will you still maintain the devotion on God, Brahma?

3349
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
 Out of hundred, ninety will go away.

3350
00:12:38 --> 00:12:43
 In Brahmapareesha, in the quarter, twenty will go away.

3351
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
 That is quarter examination.

3352
00:12:44 --> 00:12:53
 In the half yearly middle Parishah, that is Vishnopareesha, you ask God appears, you ask

3353
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
 him some hundred rupees.

3354
00:12:55 --> 00:13:00
 Then he says, okay, I will give you, then he will search your pockets.

3355
00:13:00 --> 00:13:05
 If some ten rupees is there, then you will get the boon.

3356
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
 Not giving, but taking away our also, ours also.

3357
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
 Then will you still love God?

3358
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
 That is Vishnopareesha.

3359
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
 And Rudraparesha is the final annual test.

3360
00:13:16 --> 00:13:23
 In Rudraparesha, he will give you some hundred rupees, then he will give you some hundred

3361
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
 rupees.

3362
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3363
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3364
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3365
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3366
00:13:30 --> 00:13:31
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3367
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3368
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3369
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3370
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3371
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3372
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3373
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3374
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3375
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3376
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3377
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3378
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3379
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3380
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3381
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3382
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3383
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3384
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3385
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3386
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3387
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3388
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3389
00:13:53 --> 00:13:54
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3390
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3391
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3392
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3393
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3394
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3395
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3396
00:14:00 --> 00:14:01
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3397
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3398
00:14:02 --> 00:14:03
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3399
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3400
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3401
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3402
00:14:06 --> 00:14:07
 Then he will give you some hundred rupees.

3403
00:14:07 --> 00:14:14
 And if you pass Rudra Paritasha also, then God Darta will appear and will merge in you

3404
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
 and will make you as God Darta.

3405
00:14:18 --> 00:14:27
 He will never allow the source to merge in him.

3406
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
 He merges in the source.

3407
00:14:30 --> 00:14:38
 That is in your name, in your name, your life, your identity is maintained.

3408
00:14:38 --> 00:14:45
 And you will do the, you will get all the powers of God Darta.

3409
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
 That is more, you know.

3410
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
 Instead of you will disappear and dissolve in him.

3411
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
 Then he does something.

3412
00:14:51 --> 00:14:55
 The credit goes to God Darta only, not to you.

3413
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
 Is it not?

3414
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
 So the salvation given by Darta is very peculiar, different.

3415
00:15:01 --> 00:15:12
 That is the soul will dissolve in, the God will dissolve in the soul and the soul will not dissolve in the God.

3416
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
 That is the final fruit given by Darta.

3417
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
 Okay?

3418
00:15:17 --> 00:15:21
 Okay Swami. One more question Swami.

3419
00:15:21 --> 00:15:27
 Jesus was crucified among two thieves on either side.

3420
00:15:27 --> 00:15:33
 Any message in that being crucified with two thieves?

3421
00:15:33 --> 00:15:41
 You see, if you take their statements, they are completely different from the statements of Jesus.

3422
00:15:41 --> 00:15:48
 See somebody, one says that when you go there, you also remember me.

3423
00:15:48 --> 00:15:53
 See it is a question like bribing.

3424
00:15:53 --> 00:16:04
 They both are not, see when Jesus was crucified, he never gave any statement harassing anybody.

3425
00:16:04 --> 00:16:11
 He never begged those people to show kindness on his life.

3426
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
 He never begged.

3427
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
 He did not say anything.

3428
00:16:15 --> 00:16:20
 Then he said, Oh God, they don't know what they are doing.

3429
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
 You please excuse them.

3430
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
 That is the level of Jesus.

3431
00:16:25 --> 00:16:29
 The level of the two thieves are not that.

3432
00:16:29 --> 00:16:37
 So he is showing the difference of the human incarnation and ordinary people.

3433
00:16:37 --> 00:16:47
 One may be like an ordinary devotee who asked him to remember him when he sits on the lap of the father.

3434
00:16:47 --> 00:16:53
 He may be treated as a worldly devotee, aspiring for some aspiration.

3435
00:16:53 --> 00:17:00
 And other fellow is a worldly man, other person, prisoner.

3436
00:17:00 --> 00:17:10
 And the statements given by Jesus, the behavior shown by Jesus, proves that he is the human incarnation.

3437
00:17:10 --> 00:17:16
 And the other two are, one is a devotee, another is an ordinary soul.

3438
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
 Okay?

3439
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
 Okay, I am in.

3440
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
 Okay, Swami. Thank you. Thank you.

3441
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
 Okay, okay.

3442
00:17:26 --> 00:17:32
 Okay.

3443
00:17:32 --> 00:18:13
 Where is your wife?

3444
00:18:13 --> 00:18:26
 I am the wife of your husband.

3445
00:18:26 --> 00:18:48
 Okay.

3446
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
 I have already told that concept.

3447
00:18:52 --> 00:18:54
 In Veda, it is told,

3448
00:18:54 --> 00:19:08
 The so-called males in the world are not only females, but are also wives of God.

3449
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
 That is in Veda.

3450
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
 Because husband means bharta.

3451
00:19:14 --> 00:19:16
 Bharta means,

3452
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
 Who maintains.

3453
00:19:18 --> 00:19:22
 God is maintaining all the souls.

3454
00:19:22 --> 00:19:24
 Bharya means,

3455
00:19:24 --> 00:19:28
 Who is maintained.

3456
00:19:28 --> 00:19:35
 So, not in other sense, but in this sense you have to take that word.

3457
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
 Not only female, but also the wife of God.

3458
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45
 That means the male ego should be left.

3459
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49
 Male ego should not be shown on the wife.

3460
00:19:49 --> 00:19:52
 For that, that statement is given.

3461
00:19:52 --> 00:19:56
 So, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, when he went to Burundavana,

3462
00:19:56 --> 00:20:04
 For one month, he was wearing shari and putting jewels like gotga.

3463
00:20:04 --> 00:20:10
 So, all souls before God,

3464
00:20:10 --> 00:20:12
 Before God,

3465
00:20:12 --> 00:20:15
 They should not have any trace of ego.

3466
00:20:15 --> 00:20:19
 That is the meaning of the statement.

3467
00:20:19 --> 00:20:22
 You are misusing that here.

3468
00:20:22 --> 00:20:25
 I am using correct sense.

3469
00:20:25 --> 00:20:27
 Sarva Bharta.

3470
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
 Even you use that,

3471
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
 The sense is not the relationship of husband and wife.

3472
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
 That is not the sense.

3473
00:20:36 --> 00:20:38
 Vibharti is the bharta.

3474
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
 He who maintains, the substratum,

3475
00:20:40 --> 00:20:44
 The electronic instrument is on the table.

3476
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
 That table is bharta and that is bharia.

3477
00:20:47 --> 00:20:50
 Bharya means that is maintained.

3478
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
 This is maintaining.

3479
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
 Maintainer is bharta.

3480
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
 Maintained article, maintained item is bharya.

3481
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
 In that sense, all souls, even the so called males,

3482
00:21:04 --> 00:21:07
 Are females and wives of God.

3483
00:21:07 --> 00:21:12
 But that means even the males are maintained by God only.

3484
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
 They are not maintaining angels.

3485
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
 Because of God only.

3486
00:21:17 --> 00:21:20
 Everything, all the entire creation is maintained by God.

3487
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
 Then males are also included in the creation.

3488
00:21:23 --> 00:21:30
 Thank you.

3489
00:21:30 --> 00:22:00
 Namaskaram.
