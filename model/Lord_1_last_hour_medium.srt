1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:07
 also by all the human beings, all the common human. This is the desire. This is the main

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
 desire hidden. You also don't know that. That is hidden in every soul. Based on that,

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
 it is born with that and then it sees some common human incarnation, common human medium

4
00:00:21 --> 00:00:28
 incarnation, like Krishna, Rama, etc. Then immediately this hidden idea comes out as

5
00:00:29 --> 00:00:36
 ego based jealousy. Then what it will do, you know? No, no, no, don't be hurry. Let

6
00:00:38 --> 00:00:45
 me worship this human incarnation and rise and become myself human incarnation. Then

7
00:00:45 --> 00:00:52
 I can throw him out. Then only I can become famous in the world. First I shall become.

8
00:00:52 --> 00:00:59
 For becoming, I must take his help. So let me become devotee. Not due to the appreciation

9
00:01:01 --> 00:01:08
 of the human incarnation, not due to the love towards human incarnation. I will serve him,

10
00:01:09 --> 00:01:16
 I will worship him so that I will become one day human incarnation. Then I will become

11
00:01:16 --> 00:01:23
 famous in the world. These two ideas, to become greatest and to project great as greatest,

12
00:01:26 --> 00:01:33
 these are hidden two diseases like BP and heart attack. Two, everywhere it is the reason.

13
00:01:33 --> 00:01:40
 If anybody is developing love, devotion, it is only selfish. Either to solve his worldly

14
00:01:46 --> 00:01:53
 problems or to become human incarnation. So this is the infrastructure. In this infrastructure,

15
00:01:53 --> 00:02:00
 how to rectify this? That is, the fundamental defect itself should be rectified. That fundamental

16
00:02:00 --> 00:02:07
 idea to become God and to become famous as God, that should be changed. You must replace

17
00:02:11 --> 00:02:18
 those desires by, I must serve God. I must become the God of God. I must become the God

18
00:02:23 --> 00:02:30
 of God. I must become the servant of God. I don't want to become God. I must serve

19
00:02:31 --> 00:02:38
 the God. That fundamental replacement must be done. And real love is that when there

20
00:02:42 --> 00:02:49
 is no aspiration in return, fan devotion. So that fundamental reformation, the whole

21
00:02:49 --> 00:02:56
 infrastructure should be changed. Then it will go in the right path. Then really it

22
00:03:02 --> 00:03:09
 does not aspire to become human incarnation, becomes a servant. That becomes the real human

23
00:03:11 --> 00:03:18
 incarnation in the course of time. When you aspire for that, you become permanently disqualified.

24
00:03:20 --> 00:03:27
 When you don't aspire for that, God will make you. God is always reverse. Man proposes,

25
00:03:30 --> 00:03:37
 God disposes. So that is the thing. What did I say? Particular human incarnation, that

26
00:03:49 --> 00:03:56
 is the thing. Nothing like that. You see, it is, free will is there always. You may

27
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
 catch the contemporary human incarnation, you may not catch. You may stick to some past

28
00:04:02 --> 00:04:09
 human incarnation. You may stick to the energetic incarnation, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, like that.

29
00:04:10 --> 00:04:17
 It is free will. It is your free will. Not force. Through, in the atmosphere of freedom,

30
00:04:19 --> 00:04:26
 free will only you must develop that contemporary human. You must attach to contemporary human

31
00:04:26 --> 00:04:33
 incarnation, yourself, not by the force of God. At the same time, many contemporary,

32
00:04:38 --> 00:04:43
 multiple contemporary human incarnations may be present at the same time. Not multiple,

33
00:04:43 --> 00:04:50
 just one or two or three. That is all. Not many. Just one or two. Like Parashurama and

34
00:04:50 --> 00:04:57
 Shrirama, same time. Ramakrishna Pahamsa, Shirdi Sai Baba, Kolkata Maharaja and Gajan

35
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
 Maharaja. Like that, some, very few. Very few.

36
00:05:05 --> 00:05:11
 Is it the will of the devotee to serve that particular contemporary human incarnation

37
00:05:11 --> 00:05:18
 or is it the will of the God to... Will of the devotee only. God has no necessity.

38
00:05:22 --> 00:05:29
 God doesn't will. All the wills, all the wishes of God are fulfilled. No need of any fresh

39
00:05:32 --> 00:05:39
 will. Will is always for the soul whose wishes are not fulfilled. All wishes are not fulfilled.

40
00:05:42 --> 00:05:49
 So, that is why he says, if you put one step to me, I will put hundred steps. But the first

41
00:05:53 --> 00:06:00
 step is from the side of soul only. Not from his side.

42
00:06:02 --> 00:06:09
 Swami, before Mahapralaya, I have seen a lot of people who are not following the path

43
00:06:11 --> 00:06:16
 of creation. The creation is in gross state. After Mahapralaya, the creation is in subtle

44
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
 state. In both states, it is real only. Yes. Subtle and gross, both are real.

45
00:06:21 --> 00:06:28
 Both are real. Before creation, it was unreal and it will be real forever. Can I take it

46
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
 like that? Yes. Before creation, it was unreal. Before

47
00:06:31 --> 00:06:38
 the first creation, it was unreal. Then later on, it is only... Creation means coming from

48
00:06:39 --> 00:06:46
 subtle state to gross state and dissolution means coming from gross state to subtle state.

49
00:06:48 --> 00:06:55
 Before the first creation, it was unreal. Then it was created. Later on, it is going

50
00:06:55 --> 00:07:02
 from gross state to subtle, subtle to gross state. It is just like before taking the film,

51
00:07:02 --> 00:07:09
 first shooting, it was not existing. Not existing.

52
00:07:09 --> 00:07:16
 After the cinema is shot, then it is in the form of film, subtle state, exposed on the

53
00:07:17 --> 00:07:24
 character, gross state. So, it is real. It is forever. And what is its reality? Its reality

54
00:07:24 --> 00:07:31
 is gifted reality from the ultimate God. By itself, it is still unreal. If you separate

55
00:07:35 --> 00:07:42
 it from the support of God, it does not exist. So, he maintains it continuously real so that

56
00:07:42 --> 00:07:49
 he can entertain with some internal gaps. Why did Avatara Meherbaba say, everything

57
00:08:01 --> 00:08:08
 is illusion. God is the only reality. Is it from his perspective or is it from a devotee's

58
00:08:12 --> 00:08:19
 perspective? See, that is what Shankara told also. Shankara told the same thing. See, it

59
00:08:27 --> 00:08:34
 can help the devotee to concentrate on God. If you are told that this is unreal, God alone

60
00:08:34 --> 00:08:41
 is real, then you will concentrate on God, leaving these worldly things. That helps the

61
00:08:46 --> 00:08:53
 devotee like that. It is a helping step. Coming to the reality, coming to the logical side,

62
00:08:57 --> 00:09:04
 before its creation, it was unreal. Even while existing, by itself it is unreal. It is unreal.

63
00:09:04 --> 00:09:11
 It is real only because of God's gifted reality. So, nothing wrong to say like that. But at

64
00:09:15 --> 00:09:22
 the same time, when God's gifted reality, God's gifted reality means he has sacrificed,

65
00:09:22 --> 00:09:29
 he has donated his own reality to that. How can you say it unreal? That means you are

66
00:09:30 --> 00:09:37
 saying, are you not saying that God's reality is unreal? So, it is unreal means the fellow

67
00:09:46 --> 00:09:53
 will become, he will not work. Hey, everything is unreal.

68
00:10:00 --> 00:10:07
 But when lunch time comes, hang up. That is real. So, therefore, it is, that is why Shankara

69
00:10:14 --> 00:10:21
 finally defined the reality of the world as sadhasadvilakshana midja. Neither we can say

70
00:10:21 --> 00:10:28
 it as real nor we can say it as unreal. Sat, asat, vilakshana. It is different from the

71
00:10:29 --> 00:10:36
 sat, existence and different from asat, non-existence. From the point of the reality of God donated

72
00:10:39 --> 00:10:46
 to this, it is real. Without the reality of God, it is unreal. From that angle, it is

73
00:10:49 --> 00:10:56
 asat. So, decide, no I cannot decide. It is something different from sat and asat, existence

74
00:10:57 --> 00:11:04
 and non-existence. That is why he has given, he has given a new word midja. Midja is neither

75
00:11:06 --> 00:11:13
 reality nor unreal. Midja means neither real nor unreal. Something different. So, for souls

76
00:11:13 --> 00:11:20
 we have to take the world as real, not unreal because we are part and parcel of this world.

77
00:11:27 --> 00:11:34
 When you are part and parcel of this midja world, you are also midja. How can you say

78
00:11:35 --> 00:11:42
 world as unreal and midja? God can say it is unreal. Yes, without real, it is unreal.

79
00:11:43 --> 00:11:50
 Without his reality, it becomes unreal. God can say that. Adi Shankara can say world is

80
00:11:52 --> 00:11:59
 midja because even the bolted doors he passes through each. Mananamista house. But other

81
00:11:59 --> 00:12:06
 disciples, when they try to pass. So, for God it is unreal and for souls it is unreal.

82
00:12:13 --> 00:12:20
 For soul it is real because soul is a part and parcel of the world. How the part can

83
00:12:22 --> 00:12:29
 get a new property? A sugar crystal of sugar is sweet. Whole sugar is also sweet. Same

84
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
 property must be there, part and whole. The property of the whole must come to the property

85
00:12:37 --> 00:12:44
 of the whole. So, it is not only part and parcel. When you are part of this creation,

86
00:12:44 --> 00:12:51
 you are also midja. If you say world as unreal, you will become unreal.

87
00:12:56 --> 00:13:03
 Parinamaskaram Swami. Just now you have told that due to ego and jealousy, people are losing

88
00:13:07 --> 00:13:14
 God on the earth as well as in the upper worlds. Now the souls who have lost God, how they

89
00:13:16 --> 00:13:23
 will be reformed? Will they be reformed or what is the next force of action of God towards

90
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
 those souls? By getting rid of ego based jealousy. First

91
00:13:28 --> 00:13:35
 as a training, you must get rid of this ego based jealousy in the world. Do not have jealousy

92
00:13:36 --> 00:13:43
 towards any co-human being because after all God is also appearing in co-human form. Training

93
00:13:46 --> 00:13:53
 and it is actual job. You undergo some training, then you join the job. Isn't it? Training

94
00:13:54 --> 00:14:01
 is to not to have ego based jealousy on any co-human being.

95
00:14:05 --> 00:14:12
 So, that you will eradicate ego based jealousy from your heart. So, that when you join the

96
00:14:14 --> 00:14:20
 job, that is when you face the human incarnation, you will not have that ego based jealousy.

97
00:14:20 --> 00:14:25
 Co-human being and human incarnation are one in the sense that both are having the same

98
00:14:25 --> 00:14:32
 external form. The common human media, repulsion between common human media is, it applies

99
00:14:33 --> 00:14:40
 to you towards a co-human being and also towards the human incarnation. That is the common

100
00:14:40 --> 00:14:47
 defect. So, first in the world you have the training. Do not hate anybody. Do not get

101
00:14:52 --> 00:14:59
 any repulsion with anybody. Do not show ego based jealousy on anybody.

102
00:15:00 --> 00:15:07
 So, by that you will make your mind pure. Ego based jealousy disappears completely from

103
00:15:10 --> 00:15:17
 your mind. Then when you face the human incarnation, you will not show ego based jealousy.

104
00:15:18 --> 00:15:25
 So, the advice to not to show ego based jealousy towards any co-human being is to not show

105
00:15:29 --> 00:15:36
 it towards the human incarnation. That is the purpose. Purpose is that. Purpose is not

106
00:15:40 --> 00:15:46
 to show ego based jealousy towards co-human being. It is only training. The ultimate aim

107
00:15:46 --> 00:15:53
 is that. See, there is a training. You serve every human being, thinking that every human

108
00:15:53 --> 00:16:00
 being is God. Manava seve, Madhava seve. It is good. It is a good training because God

109
00:16:03 --> 00:16:10
 comes in human form. When you serve every human form, automatically you will serve God

110
00:16:11 --> 00:16:18
 in human form also. If you hate any human form, you may hate God also in human form.

111
00:16:19 --> 00:16:26
 But this has one main essential point you should not forget. Essential point is all

112
00:16:27 --> 00:16:34
 this is training is practiced for the ultimate purpose of not hating Krishna in human form.

113
00:16:39 --> 00:16:46
 It is only training. It is not absolute reality. If everybody is really God, then why Gopikasya

114
00:16:47 --> 00:16:54
 should lose their family members and run for Krishna? They are also God. She herself is

115
00:16:56 --> 00:17:03
 God. Every human being is God. She herself is God. Why she should run for Krishna? So,

116
00:17:06 --> 00:17:13
 it is only training program. That is not the ultimate reality. To eradicate ego based jealousy

117
00:17:13 --> 00:17:20
 from your heart, a training program is prepared in which you assume every human being is

118
00:17:23 --> 00:17:30
 God. Under that word assume. Actually every human being is not God. You assume. If you

119
00:17:33 --> 00:17:39
 assume that every human being is God, then you will eradicate ego and jealousy. You will

120
00:17:39 --> 00:17:46
 not show the same ego and jealousy towards the human incarnations. For this purpose you

121
00:17:46 --> 00:17:53
 are assuming which is not a reality. If it is a reality, why should I undergo this training?

122
00:17:55 --> 00:18:02
 What is the necessity of all this training, foolish training? Only not to hate. We do

123
00:18:02 --> 00:18:09
 not know in which human form he is hidden. Suppose we insult somebody. God might be

124
00:18:13 --> 00:18:20
 insulted. As long as we do not recognize him as God, he is a human being only. We will

125
00:18:20 --> 00:18:27
 see him as human being and insult him. Show hatred at him. You are hating God. You are

126
00:18:27 --> 00:18:34
 insulting God. When I come in human form, the fools will insult me. The ignorant people,

127
00:18:42 --> 00:18:49
 mudha means ignorant people. They did not recognize me as God. So naturally they will

128
00:18:49 --> 00:18:56
 insult me. They did not know that I am God. They thought that I am a human being. Therefore

129
00:19:02 --> 00:19:09
 they insulted me. So that is a training program. You should always remember that you are not

130
00:19:19 --> 00:19:26
 a human being. You should not forget that it is a training program to serve every human

131
00:19:26 --> 00:19:33
 being treating as God. You must not forget that if you forget that it is a training program

132
00:19:34 --> 00:19:39
 and if you think that it is a real program, you will believe everybody as God, including

133
00:19:39 --> 00:19:46
 yourself, then there is no use of this training. This program is waste. So you should not forget

134
00:19:49 --> 00:19:56
 that it is a training program. It is arranged for certain purpose. You should not think

135
00:19:56 --> 00:20:03
 it as real. Manava seva, mathala seva is not real. It is an assumed statement. You treat

136
00:20:05 --> 00:20:12
 every manava as mathava and serve him. So that when mathava comes as manava, I will

137
00:20:12 --> 00:20:19
 be a manava. For that purpose this program is arranged and you really think that this

138
00:20:20 --> 00:20:27
 is a real program, this is a reality, then you are done. So you will think everybody

139
00:20:28 --> 00:20:35
 is God. You are also one among everybody. You must also think yourself as God. That

140
00:20:36 --> 00:20:43
 program is useless. So you must not forget the basic reality. When you are undergoing

141
00:20:52 --> 00:20:59
 a training, a martial training, you are going to beat somebody. That is training period.

142
00:21:00 --> 00:21:07
 In actual war, you beat him till he dies. But in training program, you should not beat

143
00:21:09 --> 00:21:16
 him till he dies. It is a training program. It is not the real war. So that awareness

144
00:21:17 --> 00:21:24
 you must have. Manava seva, mathava seva has misled several people. They really think that

145
00:21:25 --> 00:21:32
 manava seva is real mathava seva. They believe it as a fact. And they enter into politics

146
00:21:34 --> 00:21:41
 with the service of human beings. Then when you go into the hell and stand in the queue

147
00:21:43 --> 00:21:50
 for sins and punishments, then you pray God, save me. You thought, entire life you thought

148
00:21:51 --> 00:21:58
 all human beings are God. You ask them to save you. Now I am needed. You ask them, they

149
00:22:04 --> 00:22:11
 will protect you. So here actually manava seva is not mathava seva. If you want to analyze

150
00:22:11 --> 00:22:18
 that topic itself, it is not mathava seva. What is mathava seva? To serve the poor people,

151
00:22:22 --> 00:22:29
 beggars. See every rich fellow is there. Why should you serve him? A needy person, a really

152
00:22:29 --> 00:22:36
 a hit person, a beggar who is dying for food, who is dying for clothes, who is dying with

153
00:22:45 --> 00:22:52
 disease, help him. If you want to remove poverty in the society, you must first serve the beggars.

154
00:22:52 --> 00:22:59
 You must serve the poorest, then go to poorer, then go to poor. First you must see that no

155
00:23:06 --> 00:23:13
 poorest person is present in the society. Then you should attack the second phase, that is

156
00:23:13 --> 00:23:20
 poorer section. When poorest section is still remaining, why you are helping poor, poorer?

157
00:23:20 --> 00:23:27
 For votes. If your aim is to really serve the poor people, start with the poorest people.

158
00:23:35 --> 00:23:41
 When the poorest disappears, then you can serve poorer. When poorer disappears, then

159
00:23:41 --> 00:23:48
 you can serve poor. They are not discriminating the greats in poverty. So you must serve

160
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
 the poor, the poor, the poorest, everybody who is serving for the sake of votes. So the

161
00:23:57 --> 00:24:04
 concentration of service to the poorest is not there. You must give all facilities, build

162
00:24:05 --> 00:24:12
 beggar homes. You should not see any beggar in the country on the street. After achieving

163
00:24:13 --> 00:24:20
 that, then you go to the next phase. If your aim is really to remove poverty, your aim is

164
00:24:23 --> 00:24:30
 not that. Since poor, poorer, if poor people are more in number than poorer people, I will

165
00:24:33 --> 00:24:40
 serve poor only for votes. More votes will come. Poorest beggars are less in number.

166
00:24:42 --> 00:24:49
 Based on the number you are serving, is it not? Not on the need. So these things should

167
00:24:55 --> 00:25:02
 be analyzed properly and should be, you see that Vyasa told, parupakara punyaya papaya

168
00:25:04 --> 00:25:11
 parapeyena. If you help anybody, help ever and heart never. If you help anybody, you

169
00:25:12 --> 00:25:19
 can fight in the war. Is that easy to be followed? So it is not help everybody and

170
00:25:29 --> 00:25:36
 heart, none. It is help good people and heart bad people. So it is not helping everybody

171
00:25:42 --> 00:25:49
 and heart. That is there. Not help everybody and heart don't hurt anybody. That is not

172
00:25:51 --> 00:25:58
 dharma. Parupakara punyaya papaya parapeyena is not dharma. What is dharma? Paritranaayi

173
00:26:00 --> 00:26:07
 sadhuna vinashayi sadhusha. That is dharma. Helping the good people and hurting the bad

174
00:26:07 --> 00:26:14
 people is dharma. Helping everybody and hurting nobody, that is not dharma. That is simply

175
00:26:21 --> 00:26:28
 foolish blindness. This mere blindness. You are not analyzing the deservingness. Who is

176
00:26:28 --> 00:26:35
 deserving, who is undeserving? Sanvijayam. Discrimination knowledge, with that you must

177
00:26:38 --> 00:26:45
 do charity. First is sanvijayam. Patrapatra visakshana jnanam sanvit. Then hriyayam bhiya

178
00:26:45 --> 00:26:52
 jayam. Swami there is a story of scorpion and sage. So sage goes by and sees a scorpion

179
00:26:59 --> 00:27:05
 in water. He wants to save it and while taking the scorpion out it keeps on biting the sage.

180
00:27:05 --> 00:27:10
 And the disciple asks the sage why are you saving it when it is biting you. Sage says

181
00:27:10 --> 00:27:17
 that it is the nature of the scorpion to bite and hurt. It is my nature to help. So I will

182
00:27:17 --> 00:27:24
 help. Then that sage is a blind fellow. What about him? He follows paropakara phunaya papaya

183
00:27:29 --> 00:27:36
 parapeyena. Yasa's words he follows. I follow Krishna's words. Paritranaayi sadhuna vinashayi

184
00:27:36 --> 00:27:43
 kriyayam. Krishna is greater than Yasa. Yasa praised Krishna in Bhagavatam. So whose words

185
00:27:50 --> 00:27:57
 are authoritative? Krishna's words. For a Swami's words only. So what Krishna told

186
00:27:58 --> 00:28:05
 is correct. As per the context you explained jealousy and ego should be controlled by the

187
00:28:16 --> 00:28:23
 soul to eradicate the guards, avoid the obstruction of guards. When the relay bonds avoid the

188
00:28:27 --> 00:28:34
 control of the body, our own bonds are hurting us, cheating us. So being the source of ego

189
00:28:34 --> 00:28:39
 and jealousy we control. We control ego and jealousy. But when we are the objects, when

190
00:28:39 --> 00:28:46
 we are being cheated, when we are being victimized then how to control in that situation ego

191
00:28:48 --> 00:28:55
 and jealousy and how can we decide that are we punishing the bad like paritranaayi? See

192
00:28:55 --> 00:29:02
 ego and jealousy in its correct sense ego and jealousy is your hatred towards a co-human

193
00:29:07 --> 00:29:14
 being becoming greater than yourself. There only this word ego based jealousy is used.

194
00:29:15 --> 00:29:22
 Suppose somebody has done a sin, bad work, wrong work. You become angry on him. That

195
00:29:22 --> 00:29:29
 is not ego based jealousy. That is not ego. There is no jealousy there. He has cheated

196
00:29:30 --> 00:29:37
 you and you become angry and you want to punish him. You want to teach him a lesson. There

197
00:29:38 --> 00:29:45
 is no question of ego based jealousy. Ego based jealousy comes, you are in a classroom,

198
00:29:45 --> 00:29:52
 your classmate is there, he studies well, you don't study well, you get less marks,

199
00:29:52 --> 00:29:59
 he gets more marks, then you become ego based jealous. That context is completely different

200
00:29:59 --> 00:30:02
 from this context.

201
00:30:02 --> 00:30:03
 Namaste.

202
00:30:03 --> 00:30:04
 Namaste.

203
00:30:04 --> 00:30:11
 I am a student of the Indian University. I am studying in the Indian University. I am

204
00:30:16 --> 00:30:23
 standing outside from Mother's era school. I had my college where you had to go before

205
00:30:33 --> 00:30:40
 any 11 years of life. So, I was studying Medical University. Also.

206
00:30:40 --> 00:30:47
 in this program. Who is that earlier? You referred somebody earlier. Prophet Muhammad.

207
00:30:49 --> 00:30:56
 What he said? Muhammad. He fought injustice directly fighting, very directly fighting.

208
00:30:59 --> 00:31:06
 And he also preached the knowledge simultaneously. Whereas Krishna, he became as Krishna, he

209
00:31:10 --> 00:31:17
 preached the knowledge. He did not directly fought the injustice. No, Krishna also fought

210
00:31:18 --> 00:31:25
 directly injustice. He fought with several people. Several people. Jaira Sangha, the

211
00:31:27 --> 00:31:34
 Sashi Shibala, Dantavakra. Dantavakra he fought. Narakasura he fought. So he also fought. It

212
00:31:35 --> 00:31:42
 was a war between Arjuna and Kauravas, Pandavas and Kauravas. So he has to advise Arjuna

213
00:31:44 --> 00:31:51
 there. The context is not, does not invite him directly fight. And moreover, in the case

214
00:31:54 --> 00:32:01
 of Bheeshma, he took the wheel of a chariot and ran to kill Bheeshma. There when there

215
00:32:02 --> 00:32:09
 was necessity, for ten days he was fighting and Arjuna was unable to defeat him. So he

216
00:32:09 --> 00:32:16
 took the wheel of the chariot and ran towards Bheeshma to kill him. He participated in fighting.

217
00:32:18 --> 00:32:23
 People say that the wheel of the chariot is not a weapon. What is weapon? Weapon is that

218
00:32:23 --> 00:32:30
 instrument by which you destroy the other person. The wheel of the chariot is also a

219
00:32:31 --> 00:32:38
 weapon. So there in this context Arjuna is fighting with his cousins for the sake of

220
00:32:43 --> 00:32:50
 a share. There he has entered as an advisor. He also told in the beginning, I will not

221
00:32:51 --> 00:32:58
 fight directly. I will help you to advise us. When Duryodhana and Arjuna came to Krishna,

222
00:32:58 --> 00:33:05
 he put this condition. I am placing my army on one side which will fight strictly and

223
00:33:05 --> 00:33:12
 I will place on the other side. I will not fight. I will give only advices. So he has

224
00:33:14 --> 00:33:21
 to stick to that promise. Then even otherwise Krishna fought several wars. There were several

225
00:33:21 --> 00:33:28
 wars in Narakasura. He fought a big war with Narakasura directly. So many wars. He was

226
00:33:31 --> 00:33:38
 always surrounded by enemies. He fought several wars against injustice.

227
00:33:51 --> 00:33:58
 Swamy, earth and all the worlds below are materialistic worlds to my understanding

228
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
 and they are in gross state. All the upper worlds above earth are energetic worlds are

229
00:34:12 --> 00:34:18
 in subtle state if you consider like that. Now after Mahapralaya when the creation goes

230
00:34:18 --> 00:34:25
 to subtle state I can imagine that the earth and the worlds below are becoming subtle and

231
00:34:27 --> 00:34:34
 will the upper worlds remain the same? No. There is a difference between gross energy

232
00:34:36 --> 00:34:43
 and subtle energy. The gross energy also will go into the subtle energy state. Almost space.

233
00:34:44 --> 00:34:51
 Space is the subtle energy. Almost you think it is nothing. You say space is nothing? Yes.

234
00:34:55 --> 00:35:02
 So that subtle state also appears as space. Very subtle. So therefore even the gross energetic

235
00:35:02 --> 00:35:09
 worlds go into subtler states. Most subtle state that is. Even the upper worlds which

236
00:35:12 --> 00:35:19
 are in subtle state will go to even more subtle state? Most subtle. It can never be known

237
00:35:22 --> 00:35:29
 by any method. The so called subtle states energy can be known easily. Gross energy is

238
00:35:32 --> 00:35:39
 mass energy can be known very easily by heat, light. So they go to most subtle state that

239
00:35:41 --> 00:35:48
 is called as avyaktam. Avyaktam means not experienced by any means. You cannot experience

240
00:35:50 --> 00:35:57
 it all. Only God is experiencing it. Because if his experience is not there then it will

241
00:35:57 --> 00:36:04
 disappear. That is the support. Is it unimaginable God? Is it God dhatha in energetic form? Who

242
00:36:08 --> 00:36:15
 is enjoying? See it is actually God dhatha only. In Ishvara only this world dissolves

243
00:36:15 --> 00:36:22
 because there is no difference, no trace of difference between God dhatha and unimaginable

244
00:36:26 --> 00:36:33
 God. The entire unimaginable God has become God dhatha. The naked person in the bathroom

245
00:36:33 --> 00:36:40
 became dhatha. The entire naked person became dhatha. Then this dhatha person alone remains.

246
00:36:52 --> 00:36:59
 There is no naked person in the bathroom again. So that unimaginable God is mediated as God

247
00:37:03 --> 00:37:10
 dhatha. Further incarnations, further creation are all done by God dhatha. He merges. Here

248
00:37:16 --> 00:37:23
 the actual unimaginable God has become God dhatha. So that the definition given by Veda

249
00:37:24 --> 00:37:31
 to unimaginable God strictly applies as it is to God dhatha.

250
00:37:33 --> 00:37:40
 So after Mahapralaya also God dhatha will remain in energetic form, not in subtle energetic

251
00:37:43 --> 00:37:49
 form but in his energetic complete energetic form. But the rest of the creation will go

252
00:37:49 --> 00:37:56
 into most subtle form. Yes. That paramavyoma is the space required for God dhatha. That

253
00:37:57 --> 00:38:04
 is always eternal. Space and the energy that form used, all that is eternal.

254
00:38:06 --> 00:38:13
 So rest of the soul will become like akasha. Like akasha. Akasha also is considered to

255
00:38:13 --> 00:38:20
 be gross state compared to that subtle state. Even akasha disappears into that subtle state.

256
00:38:29 --> 00:38:36
 Most subtle state. Ariyatma. Ariyatma is not at all experienced by anybody except God.

257
00:38:38 --> 00:38:43
 Such a subtle state it goes. Swami, this is question from Rama Khan.

258
00:38:43 --> 00:38:50
 He says that when the creation also goes into most subtle state and gets dissolved, even

259
00:38:53 --> 00:38:59
 the devotees also get dissolved along with all other souls. So devotion how can it be

260
00:38:59 --> 00:39:05
 permanent? No, no. Devotees also exist as souls in subtle

261
00:39:05 --> 00:39:09
 state. Devotees are souls only. Yes.

262
00:39:09 --> 00:39:16
 They exist in subtle state. When a devotee exists, devotion also exists. Devotion is

263
00:39:18 --> 00:39:25
 not a separate entity. It is based on the devotee only. Everything exists.

264
00:39:26 --> 00:39:33
 Then universe is written by dhatha yadapurva makal payan. Then obviously all the samskaras,

265
00:39:33 --> 00:39:40
 devotees will remain as it is. Yes. Same souls will come back. Same total

266
00:39:43 --> 00:39:48
 picture. Same total picture. Whatever the samskaras they are holding or whatever samskaras

267
00:39:48 --> 00:39:55
 they are having before while dissolution. Yes. Yes. Same. Same.

268
00:39:55 --> 00:40:02
 Same. As it is. Dhyapurva as existed before, as existed in the past, as existed in the

269
00:40:03 --> 00:40:10
 past, as existed before, dhatha yadapurva makal payan. Same creation, same film role

270
00:40:12 --> 00:40:17
 is projected again as a picture. Yes. Correct.

271
00:40:17 --> 00:40:24
 So will there be any change unless you censor something? God also censors. God also censors

272
00:40:25 --> 00:40:32
 some certain things. He may censor certain things. He has the power. He has the freedom.

273
00:40:32 --> 00:40:39
 He censors but minor points only. Generally 99% as it is comes out. Swami you told that

274
00:40:41 --> 00:40:47
 God comes as kalki at the end of the creation and with his electric sword he will destroy

275
00:40:47 --> 00:40:54
 only bad from the souls and only good will be retained at the stage of mahabralaya. Yes

276
00:40:54 --> 00:41:01
 when such a ghastly punishment is given, generally bad gets destroyed and good comes out.

277
00:41:02 --> 00:41:06
 Good only remains. Isn't it contradicting with the previous statement which says as

278
00:41:06 --> 00:41:13
 it is all the souls? As it is means after destruction of Kali. Whatever

279
00:41:15 --> 00:41:21
 is the state after destruction of Kali, that is will return back. That is why the Kuru

280
00:41:21 --> 00:41:28
 Yuga is going to be very pure. So here while in the creation we have to put

281
00:41:29 --> 00:41:35
 lot of effort to destroy the bad in us but even if we don't take any effort, at the

282
00:41:35 --> 00:41:42
 end of the creation Kali is coming and destroying our bad. Kalki. Kalki. God Kalki is destroying

283
00:41:43 --> 00:41:50
 the bad in us. Yes. So what is the motivation for us to put effort and grow in the spiritual

284
00:41:52 --> 00:41:55
 path because at the end of the day everybody is going to be destroyed. No, no what is destruction

285
00:41:55 --> 00:42:02
 means you see a thief is taken into police station and a third degree torture is given

286
00:42:04 --> 00:42:11
 to him. At that time he swears that he will not do stealing again but that stealing nature

287
00:42:11 --> 00:42:18
 remains him as an electron. It is very small. It is karmasesham, gunasesham. That when its

288
00:42:21 --> 00:42:28
 congenial atmosphere appears it will grow again. So the reason for this is that when

289
00:42:28 --> 00:42:35
 the souls were all good then you can say 99.999999% good but 0.000001% bad remains there. So

290
00:42:49 --> 00:42:56
 the reason for this is that when the souls were all good then you can say 99.99999999%

291
00:42:58 --> 00:43:05
 bad. Atmosphere is not there. Atmosphere is not there. When everybody is having 99.9999%

292
00:43:05 --> 00:43:12
 atmosphere also will be 99.9999% only. Yes. What is atmosphere? Atmosphere does not mean

293
00:43:12 --> 00:43:19
 air, heat, light. Family atmosphere. The qualities of the souls. The qualities of the souls is

294
00:43:21 --> 00:43:26
 called atmosphere. Yes. So according to the qualities of the souls the atmosphere will

295
00:43:26 --> 00:43:33
 be there. Then that is why it is told that punishment will not remove the, cannot bring

296
00:43:37 --> 00:43:44
 permanent real reformation. It can bring only temporary reformation. Only spiritual knowledge

297
00:43:44 --> 00:43:51
 can bring 100% reformation. Punishment becomes, punishment brings only major reformation.

298
00:43:51 --> 00:43:58
 The thief will not do stealing for some months. Definitely he will not think of stealing.

299
00:44:01 --> 00:44:08
 Slowly that little association with thieves slowly doubts. So again it will come into

300
00:44:11 --> 00:44:18
 Kuru Yuga to Uttarathar, Dwapara, Kali and again go to Kuru Ra. Cycle goes on repeating.

301
00:44:21 --> 00:44:28
 Yes. It is a cycle. It is a cycle running for a long time and it will run for a long

302
00:44:42 --> 00:44:49
 time. I can see my inability to be projected as good. I can see my inability to be projected

303
00:44:51 --> 00:44:58
 as good women among all for sure. I could see my inbuilt desire to be projected as good

304
00:44:59 --> 00:45:06
 women among all for sure. But I never thought about become God. How do I don't know about

305
00:45:06 --> 00:45:13
 my desire? Which kind of ignorance it is? Again you must repeat it again. Swami Jasna

306
00:45:13 --> 00:45:20
 you told that every human soul want to become God that is their inherent desire. Inherent

307
00:45:20 --> 00:45:27
 desire. But as per my conscious is there I can detect my desire to be good women projected

308
00:45:29 --> 00:45:34
 to be good women. What does it mean? Tell me.

309
00:45:34 --> 00:45:41
 Good women. But I don't know about the desire to become incarnation.

310
00:45:41 --> 00:45:48
 Not now. It will come slowly. High school after passing high school you will desire

311
00:45:54 --> 00:46:01
 for college. Passing college you will go to leaders. It is hidden desire. Already there

312
00:46:01 --> 00:46:08
 it is not projected because proper time has not come. Now you have seen a human incarnation

313
00:46:13 --> 00:46:20
 becoming God. I must be human being. Why not I become human incarnation like him? No don't

314
00:46:20 --> 00:46:27
 be hurry. The intellect will want. Must you serve him and know the secret how he became

315
00:46:27 --> 00:46:34
 human incarnation? Know the secret. Then you can become. So all this you see that is

316
00:46:39 --> 00:46:46
 natural everybody wants to become highest and to project himself as highest in the entire

317
00:46:47 --> 00:46:54
 world. By simply becoming highest he is not satisfied. He must be projected also.

318
00:46:57 --> 00:47:04
 That is why these preachers also they are worried about the propagation, their propagation,

319
00:47:05 --> 00:47:12
 their field, their name. Like that they are worried.

320
00:47:13 --> 00:47:20
 Sorry. Just now about creation you have told. Now when the new creation is formed and the

321
00:47:21 --> 00:47:28
 souls of the previous before pralaya they also take birth on the earth. Right? In the

322
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
 new creation. But when they take the birth is that the Krithu Yuga with the same samskaras?

323
00:47:34 --> 00:47:41
 No no he already calkey modified the samskaras temporarily by punishment. So some trace very

324
00:47:42 --> 00:47:49
 very very little trace will remain that you can neglect. Almost it is 100 percent good.

325
00:47:52 --> 00:47:59
 Very little trace. That 100 percent good with the almost 100 percent good people are in

326
00:48:03 --> 00:48:10
 Krithu Yuga. In Krithu Yuga also sometimes some nirvana then some sins happen in the

327
00:48:11 --> 00:48:18
 Krithu Yuga. You see Somakasura stole Vedas in Krithu Yuga only. And there were demons

328
00:48:20 --> 00:48:27
 in Krithu Yuga also who did that churning of milk sea. Yes yes. Demons and devas. Yes

329
00:48:28 --> 00:48:35
 and Hiranyatsha was in Krithu Yuga. Hiranyakashipu was in Krithu Yuga. And Bali King Bali was

330
00:48:36 --> 00:48:43
 in Krithu Yuga. And Parashurama killing all Kshatriyas was also in Krithu Yuga. In fact

331
00:48:47 --> 00:48:54
 more incarnations have come in Krithu Yuga. Because even little sin appears. See it is

332
00:48:56 --> 00:49:03
 a pure white cloth. Small black dot immediately you will wash it. And then you will see the

333
00:49:05 --> 00:49:12
 black dot. But already it is dirty. Some black spot. Already it is dirty. That is why

334
00:49:15 --> 00:49:22
 God takes lot of care in propaganda. It is very significant. It is vivid clearly to the

335
00:49:25 --> 00:49:32
 eyes. You are also doing that. That trace will come. Trace will come. Yes.

336
00:49:32 --> 00:49:38
 Swami, law of superimposition is applicable if the seer is God himself creating the world

337
00:49:38 --> 00:49:45
 on himself for the sake of real and full entertainment so that all the three states Avarna, Viksepa

338
00:49:45 --> 00:49:52
 and Mala are meaningful for the sake of entertainment. You told in Trilokya Gita Swami. So Avarna,

339
00:49:53 --> 00:50:00
 Viksepa, Mala are the tools that control soul. But God can play with the soul. So it is very

340
00:50:02 --> 00:50:09
 important. Satvaraja Tamogunasmi Swami, then how come Avarna, Viksepa, Mala are meaningful

341
00:50:09 --> 00:50:16
 for the entertainment of God? No, actually in the case of God it remains only up to Avarna

342
00:50:20 --> 00:50:27
 stage. Never it becomes Viksepa and Mala. Only Avarna stage. That too as per his will.

343
00:50:28 --> 00:50:35
 But Avarna also stays as long as he will. He uses knowledge as well as ignorance. Both

344
00:50:42 --> 00:50:49
 he will be using. When he has to teach truth to Arjuna, he uses knowledge. When he is dancing

345
00:50:50 --> 00:50:57
 with Gopikas in Burundavanam, he uses ignorance.

346
00:50:57 --> 00:51:04
 So he uses both. Both knowledge and ignorance in his entertainment he uses both. So it is

347
00:51:07 --> 00:51:14
 only Avarna. It is not Viksepa. Viksepa is something else he is seeing, thinking it as

348
00:51:17 --> 00:51:24
 truth. Viksepa, Mala stages are not there. Only just by his will for the sake of entertainment

349
00:51:24 --> 00:51:31
 he does that Avarna stage. It is 6 pm Swami. Yes. So anybody has any question? Swami, Swami

350
00:51:39 --> 00:51:46
 one minute I am talking to Lavanya and Jayshree is talking to me. Right. So I am asking you

351
00:51:54 --> 00:52:22
 about the

352
00:52:22 --> 00:52:36
 Let me answer your first question.

353
00:52:36 --> 00:52:48
 See when some souls are punished for their sins, they go to animal births.

354
00:52:48 --> 00:53:05
 And when they go to animal births, the population growth is coming from some desiring upper

355
00:53:05 --> 00:53:08
 energetic souls, upper energetic bodies.

356
00:53:08 --> 00:53:21
 They want to take birth as human beings to perform karma here and earn the spiritual

357
00:53:21 --> 00:53:25
 right.

358
00:53:25 --> 00:53:32
 In upper energetic worlds, they are only having bhoga lokas.

359
00:53:32 --> 00:53:40
 They only enjoy their punya, their merit and their bad things.

360
00:53:40 --> 00:53:47
 But those who are enjoying the merit in the upper energetic worlds, those souls, they

361
00:53:47 --> 00:53:53
 want to earn more merit by taking birth on this earth.

362
00:53:53 --> 00:53:56
 Because this is karma loka.

363
00:53:56 --> 00:53:58
 Here only karma can be done.

364
00:53:58 --> 00:54:01
 In the upper worlds, karma cannot be done.

365
00:54:01 --> 00:54:06
 There only they enjoy the merits.

366
00:54:06 --> 00:54:13
 And when somebody goes to heaven, he enjoys the merit and returns back.

367
00:54:13 --> 00:54:22
 And even some angels want to take birth because they want to earn some more spiritual wealth.

368
00:54:22 --> 00:54:27
 Because only expenditure is there in the upper worlds.

369
00:54:27 --> 00:54:28
 No earning.

370
00:54:28 --> 00:54:38
 Even angels wish to take birth of human beings.

371
00:54:38 --> 00:54:46
 This human birth, I am praising, even angels want to take the human birth because in this

372
00:54:46 --> 00:54:50
 human birth you can earn.

373
00:54:50 --> 00:54:56
 There only spending your karma phalas.

374
00:54:56 --> 00:54:57
 There you can earn karma loka.

375
00:54:57 --> 00:54:58
 This is karma loka.

376
00:54:58 --> 00:55:02
 Those are only bhoga lokas.

377
00:55:02 --> 00:55:06
 So they take human births.

378
00:55:06 --> 00:55:14
 And some of these people becoming very worst people, worst, no hope for any change, they

379
00:55:14 --> 00:55:18
 will enter animal births.

380
00:55:18 --> 00:55:28
 So this total figure of population is the barration of God.

381
00:55:28 --> 00:55:32
 It will not help us spiritually in any way.

382
00:55:32 --> 00:55:39
 It is only a statistical data about which God only has to worry.

383
00:55:39 --> 00:55:42
 His administration point.

384
00:55:42 --> 00:55:44
 We need not worry about that point.

385
00:55:44 --> 00:55:49
 That will not help us in spiritual efforts, in spiritual progress.

386
00:55:49 --> 00:55:53
 It is unnecessary for us.

387
00:55:53 --> 00:55:56
 It is immaterial for us.

388
00:55:56 --> 00:56:03
 What Shankara says in his commentary that the Puru Patshi asked, when this creation

389
00:56:03 --> 00:56:08
 was created exact date I want.

390
00:56:08 --> 00:56:13
 Then Shankara says, what is the use of that for our spirit?

391
00:56:13 --> 00:56:21
 We are doing all this spiritual knowledge efforts only to get the grace of God.

392
00:56:21 --> 00:56:24
 For that the date of birth of the creation is not necessary.

393
00:56:24 --> 00:56:27
 For you it is not necessary.

394
00:56:27 --> 00:56:32
 That is told in the administration of God.

395
00:56:32 --> 00:56:35
 What is the use of that?

396
00:56:35 --> 00:56:36
 It is his worry.

397
00:56:37 --> 00:56:43
 It is the worry of his administration to maintain the balance of outgoing souls and incoming

398
00:56:43 --> 00:56:52
 souls and to provide food for those souls who are coming.

399
00:56:52 --> 00:56:57
 All that is the divine administration about which we need not bother because it does not

400
00:56:57 --> 00:57:00
 help us in our spiritual effort.

401
00:57:00 --> 00:57:03
 Okay.

402
00:57:03 --> 00:57:06
 Okay.

403
00:57:06 --> 00:57:09
 Okay.

404
00:57:09 --> 00:57:13
 That is why

405
00:57:40 --> 00:57:47
 Once you enter into the cycle of the animals, there is no question of return back.

406
00:57:47 --> 00:57:54
 Tānaḥ viśata kuru rāṇ, samsāreṣu narādhamān, kṣipāma yajasra māshivān, āsureeshva eva

407
00:57:54 --> 00:57:55
 yonuṣu.

408
00:57:55 --> 00:58:00
 I will throw them permanently into that everlasting hell.

409
00:58:00 --> 00:58:01
 Everlasting hell?

410
00:58:01 --> 00:58:04
 No, anyāyaiyai.

411
00:58:11 --> 00:58:22
 See, that cannot be told because he is throwing them into the everlasting fire, liquid fire,

412
00:58:22 --> 00:58:27
 waiting for a reformation due to the punishment.

413
00:58:27 --> 00:58:32
 If the soul is reformed, he will take back.

414
00:58:32 --> 00:58:39
 If he is not reformed, let the punishment continue till he reforms.

415
00:58:44 --> 00:58:47
 The aim is not to take revenge against the soul.

416
00:58:48 --> 00:58:57
 The aim is to reform the soul through that punishment continuously.

417
00:58:58 --> 00:58:59
 Fundamentally.

418
00:59:01 --> 00:59:02
 Fundamentally.

419
00:59:02 --> 00:59:09
 Why should you worry about those fellows?

420
00:59:09 --> 00:59:12
 You worry about your friends.

421
00:59:12 --> 00:59:15
 Let us worry about ourselves.

422
00:59:15 --> 00:59:18
 Why should we?

423
00:59:18 --> 00:59:20
 We can't do anything.

424
00:59:20 --> 00:59:23
 We can't do anything even in our case.

425
00:59:23 --> 00:59:26
 He takes care.

426
00:59:26 --> 00:59:29
 He is the kindest Lord.

427
00:59:29 --> 00:59:34
 I told you, hell is the best example for the kindness of God.

428
00:59:34 --> 00:59:39
 Because we throw a person as a rejected, debarred fellow.

429
00:59:39 --> 00:59:41
 No, he will not change.

430
00:59:42 --> 00:59:43
 He is debarred forever.

431
00:59:43 --> 00:59:45
 But he is not debarring.

432
00:59:45 --> 00:59:50
 He is keeping the soul in the liquid fire forever.

433
00:59:50 --> 00:59:53
 Forever does not mean it is forever.

434
00:59:54 --> 00:59:57
 Till it changes, let it change.

435
00:59:57 --> 01:00:00
 There is no other way than this punishment.

436
01:00:00 --> 01:00:03
 No other way is hopeful.

437
01:00:03 --> 01:00:06
 This is the only hopeful.

438
01:00:07 --> 01:00:12
 Or if the result is not obtained, let the punishment continue still.

439
01:00:12 --> 01:00:17
 Let me maintain the soul on the artificial air system.

440
01:00:17 --> 01:00:18
 What is that?

441
01:00:18 --> 01:00:19
 Ventilation.

442
01:00:19 --> 01:00:20
 Ventilation.

443
01:00:20 --> 01:00:22
 I will pay.

444
01:00:22 --> 01:00:25
 Let the patient be maintained on ventilation forever.

445
01:00:25 --> 01:00:28
 God is prepared to pay.

446
01:00:28 --> 01:00:30
 What we do, we don't have that much money.

447
01:00:30 --> 01:00:32
 Remove that ventilation.

448
01:00:32 --> 01:00:34
 Let any of that fellow going to die.

449
01:00:35 --> 01:00:38
 Instead of tomorrow, he will die today.

450
01:00:38 --> 01:00:40
 We cannot afford.

451
01:00:40 --> 01:00:43
 We cannot afford the expenses of ventilation.

452
01:00:43 --> 01:00:45
 So we may say like that.

453
01:00:45 --> 01:00:50
 But God will say, till he dies, I will pay.

454
01:00:50 --> 01:00:52
 Let the ventilation continue.

455
01:00:52 --> 01:00:58
 He is expecting the reformation only from that soul.

456
01:00:58 --> 01:01:01
 For that only he is giving the continuous punishment.

457
01:01:01 --> 01:01:04
 Because that is really parental love.

458
01:01:04 --> 01:01:11
 Parent will never lose, will never get negative thinking about the issue.

459
01:01:11 --> 01:01:16
 He will continuously be trying to reform his issue.

460
01:01:19 --> 01:01:23
 Somebody else, some teacher or some brother or some fellow,

461
01:01:23 --> 01:01:27
 this fellow is unnecessary, just throw him out for a minute.

462
01:01:27 --> 01:01:29
 He won't undergo reformation.

463
01:01:30 --> 01:01:32
 But God is not like that.

464
01:01:32 --> 01:01:36
 See suppose he has lost the hope that he will not be reformed,

465
01:01:36 --> 01:01:38
 he will burn his soul there itself.

466
01:01:38 --> 01:01:41
 But he is not destroying the soul.

467
01:01:43 --> 01:01:45
 Nippu aralu puru ku sawadhu.

468
01:01:45 --> 01:01:48
 He is not taking away the life of the soul.

469
01:01:48 --> 01:01:54
 He is keeping the soul permanently with the hope that it will reform.

470
01:01:54 --> 01:01:56
 That is why he is not killing the soul.

471
01:01:57 --> 01:02:00
 He is continuing the ventilation.

472
01:02:00 --> 01:02:05
 He is paying the ventilation charges forever.

473
01:02:05 --> 01:02:10
 With the hope one day that my issue will be reformed.

474
01:02:10 --> 01:02:12
 Ok.

475
01:02:16 --> 01:02:19
 Swami, Anandam's won't have awareness, how will they reform them?

476
01:02:19 --> 01:02:26
 You see, sometimes you know, Srikalahasthya Mahachyam,

477
01:02:26 --> 01:02:31
 the spider got salvation, the elephant got salvation,

478
01:02:31 --> 01:02:33
 the serpent got salvation.

479
01:02:33 --> 01:02:37
 It is the hope of the father.

480
01:02:37 --> 01:02:43
 You are only brother, brother of the animal.

481
01:02:43 --> 01:02:47
 That is why I am father, why unnecessary paying so much.

482
01:02:48 --> 01:02:51
 Ventilation charges, because his share will be reduced,

483
01:02:51 --> 01:02:53
 if the father pays.

484
01:02:53 --> 01:02:56
 So, why should we pay for the ventilation charges?

485
01:02:56 --> 01:02:59
 Let it be removed, anyway he will die.

486
01:02:59 --> 01:03:01
 After four or five days he will die.

487
01:03:01 --> 01:03:05
 For four or five days so many rupees we have to pay.

488
01:03:05 --> 01:03:07
 So remove this ventilation.

489
01:03:07 --> 01:03:10
 A brother may recommend, but not father.

490
01:03:10 --> 01:03:14
 No, I cannot remove that permanently.

491
01:03:15 --> 01:03:19
 He maintains, that is why he maintains the soul, unnecessarily.

492
01:03:19 --> 01:03:24
 Even though the expenditure is on God from his administration only.

493
01:03:24 --> 01:03:27
 He maintains that.

494
01:03:27 --> 01:03:34
 Like with the hope, I am the father of all these souls.

495
01:03:34 --> 01:03:37
 So he has got hope.

496
01:03:37 --> 01:03:40
 That is why he is not destroying the soul.

497
01:03:41 --> 01:03:44
 Nippu aaradam purugu chavadam.

498
01:03:44 --> 01:03:48
 He does not kill the purugu, that is soul.

499
01:03:48 --> 01:03:52
 He maintains the nippu by paying the ventilation charges.

500
01:03:52 --> 01:03:54
 Forever.

501
01:03:54 --> 01:03:56
 Let it be forever.

502
01:03:56 --> 01:04:00
 I cannot kill my own issue with my own hands.

503
01:04:00 --> 01:04:04
 He always have hope for reformation.

504
01:04:11 --> 01:04:14
 Animals.

505
01:04:14 --> 01:04:17
 You asked one, sometime this question.

506
01:04:17 --> 01:04:19
 I already answered.

507
01:04:19 --> 01:04:22
 Previous satsang.

508
01:04:22 --> 01:04:27
 He asked when it is born as animal.

509
01:04:27 --> 01:04:34
 You see we are eating the feast with vada, payasam and all those.

510
01:04:34 --> 01:04:39
 Puri masala and all that we are enjoying.

511
01:04:39 --> 01:04:42
 Whereas it is eating the grass.

512
01:04:42 --> 01:04:51
 How you told that God has given the same facilities, eating, drinking, sleeping and producing children.

513
01:04:51 --> 01:04:55
 That four facilities, God has given to the animal also.

514
01:04:55 --> 01:05:01
 There is no difference between human being and animal as far as these four are concerned.

515
01:05:01 --> 01:05:05
 The same four facilities I will maintain in the animal state also.

516
01:05:05 --> 01:05:08
 You be born as animal, why unnecessarily human being.

517
01:05:09 --> 01:05:11
 That is why God has given this.

518
01:05:11 --> 01:05:20
 Then he asked, but regarding eating facilities, we are eating so many items in the feast.

519
01:05:20 --> 01:05:23
 But it is eating the green grass.

520
01:05:23 --> 01:05:30
 Then I told him, you are seeing the grass as a human being with your eyes.

521
01:05:30 --> 01:05:34
 You are not seeing the grass as animal with its eyes.

522
01:05:35 --> 01:05:42
 As animal for its eyes, it will appear as vada, payasam and all.

523
01:05:47 --> 01:05:50
 Nowadays in Hyderabad, animals are also eating bhavachi puri.

524
01:05:53 --> 01:05:58
 My uncle's son, he is a doctor studying MBS.

525
01:05:58 --> 01:06:01
 He married an intercast marriage.

526
01:06:02 --> 01:06:06
 You know we are Brahmins and our people are against that.

527
01:06:08 --> 01:06:15
 So my uncle requested me to go to my brother and advise him.

528
01:06:16 --> 01:06:19
 Then I went to the medical college, Guntur.

529
01:06:20 --> 01:06:25
 I was thinking how beautiful she must be.

530
01:06:25 --> 01:06:35
 When this fellow, disobeying the parents, disobeying the traditions, married that girl,

531
01:06:35 --> 01:06:38
 how beautiful she must be.

532
01:06:38 --> 01:06:45
 Let me have some strength of spiritual scripture so that I will not faint by seeing her beauty.

533
01:06:45 --> 01:06:47
 Like that I was thinking and going.

534
01:06:48 --> 01:06:52
 Then I went there, most black looking like a monkey.

535
01:06:55 --> 01:06:59
 Then I asked him, you fellow, how did you marry this girl?

536
01:06:59 --> 01:07:01
 He is beautiful.

537
01:07:02 --> 01:07:06
 Then what he told me, Anna, see her with my eyes.

538
01:07:13 --> 01:07:16
 Don't see with your eyes, see her with my eyes.

539
01:07:17 --> 01:07:26
 Similarly, you are seeing the grass with your eyes as human being.

540
01:07:27 --> 01:07:29
 See the grass with each eyes.

541
01:07:30 --> 01:07:35
 Becoming an animal with each eyes, you see the grass.

542
01:07:35 --> 01:07:38
 It will appear as vada, payasam.

543
01:07:39 --> 01:07:52
 Swami, while explaining Eshwarathrayam also, you illustrate that every soul has cross among the animal and animal births.

544
01:07:52 --> 01:07:57
 They have relation among mother, father, wife, children like that.

545
01:07:57 --> 01:08:05
 So most obviously every soul is having different path, one has that in matter.

546
01:08:05 --> 01:08:13
 Maybe depends on the case of the soul, it is a specific case, you cannot generalize.

547
01:08:15 --> 01:08:22
 According to his prominent merits and sins, the soul takes births.

548
01:08:23 --> 01:08:28
 So there is always nanatma, bahutam, multiplicity.

549
01:08:29 --> 01:08:31
 Multiplicity is very much.

550
01:08:32 --> 01:08:35
 You cannot compare one case with other case.

551
01:08:36 --> 01:08:44
 Everybody has its own specific way, its own specific nature, its own specific story.

552
01:08:46 --> 01:08:48
 You cannot generalize.

553
01:08:49 --> 01:08:51
 What is your actual question?

554
01:08:52 --> 01:08:59
 While Eshwarathrayam, you told that every soul has a bond of mother, father, children.

555
01:08:59 --> 01:09:01
 Even in animal births also.

556
01:09:02 --> 01:09:03
 So that is why it is strong.

557
01:09:04 --> 01:09:10
 So by this we could conclude that every soul is elevating from the animal births only.

558
01:09:11 --> 01:09:13
 Not like that I told.

559
01:09:14 --> 01:09:22
 Even assuming he might be in human birth and he might have been mother or father in previous human births.

560
01:09:23 --> 01:09:30
 Even if you assume that he must have some animal births previously also, then also there also this is common.

561
01:09:33 --> 01:09:35
 That is why it has become the strongest bond.

562
01:09:35 --> 01:09:41
 Putreshana, Dareshana, Dhaneshana, they have become strongest bonds.

563
01:09:42 --> 01:09:47
 Because even if somebody becomes animal, it always searches for its food.

564
01:09:49 --> 01:09:50
 That is dhana.

565
01:09:51 --> 01:09:53
 By wealth only we are eating our food.

566
01:09:54 --> 01:09:56
 So there is no difference between food and dhana.

567
01:09:57 --> 01:10:00
 Dhana lakshmi and dhanja lakshmi, both are one and the same.

568
01:10:01 --> 01:10:08
 So even if you assume that it has passed through several animal births,

569
01:10:09 --> 01:10:16
 that strengthening of the Dareshana, Putreshana, Dhaneshana need not be avoided.

570
01:10:18 --> 01:10:21
 Because those animals also, these bonds are very strong.

571
01:10:22 --> 01:10:26
 The other bonds may not be present, but these basic bonds are present.

572
01:10:27 --> 01:10:30
 Whether it is a human being or animal or a bird.

573
01:10:31 --> 01:10:39
 So that is why every human being, assuming that it was born as animal or bird in previous birth,

574
01:10:40 --> 01:10:44
 assuming the Ancestor is the Ashram of the Lord, he is strongest.

575
01:10:45 --> 01:10:46
 That is what I told.

576
01:10:51 --> 01:10:54
 Yes, yes you can do.

577
01:10:57 --> 01:11:03
 If anybody has no merit, he will enjoy in luxuries and all that.

578
01:11:04 --> 01:11:06
 In some people it is not.

579
01:11:11 --> 01:11:17
 In my previous birth, I have lot of merit, so that I visited this temple or I met this

580
01:11:18 --> 01:11:20
 human incarnation of God, they will tell.

581
01:11:20 --> 01:11:26
 In that case also, if a person enjoys the luxuries, his merit will exhaust expenditure.

582
01:11:27 --> 01:11:35
 But in case of human incarnation of God or in spiritual path, also that merit exhausts or it will increase.

583
01:11:37 --> 01:11:45
 Because of the blessings of God, in this birth, at least by the grace of God, I have been blessed by the Guru.

584
01:11:46 --> 01:11:51
 In spiritual path also, because of the merit, I came here.

585
01:11:52 --> 01:11:53
 Even then the merit will exhaust.

586
01:11:54 --> 01:11:55
 In luxuries also, it will exhaust.

587
01:11:58 --> 01:12:03
 No, you see in luxuries, the expenditure is meaningful.

588
01:12:04 --> 01:12:05
 Expenditure of merit.

589
01:12:06 --> 01:12:12
 But in the example of spiritual example, he is going to be uplifted more and more.

590
01:12:13 --> 01:12:14
 Tending.

591
01:12:15 --> 01:12:19
 It is expenditure with ending.

592
01:12:20 --> 01:12:27
 You have spent something for ending something more.

593
01:12:28 --> 01:12:31
 You have spent something but still you are ending more.

594
01:12:32 --> 01:12:38
 But in some other case, you have spent something and further further loose.

595
01:12:39 --> 01:12:44
 Learn by learning.

596
01:12:45 --> 01:12:46
 Like that.

597
01:12:50 --> 01:12:51
 Western countries.

598
01:12:52 --> 01:12:53
 Western countries.

599
01:12:53 --> 01:12:54
 All right.

600
01:13:07 --> 01:13:08
 We shall be in the satsang.

601
01:13:23 --> 01:13:27
 Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti.
