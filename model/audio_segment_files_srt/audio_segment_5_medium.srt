1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:19
 You see, there are of course eight types of devotion, all that you know, Ravana, Kirtana,

2
00:00:19 --> 00:00:26
 Vishnu, Asmara, Parasayavana, Arjuna, Vandana, Dasya, Sakya, Ata, Nivedana.

3
00:00:26 --> 00:00:33
 These nine types of devotion are told by the scripture.

4
00:00:33 --> 00:00:49
 But to make it simplify, what I say is, the best thing is to hear the details of God.

5
00:00:49 --> 00:01:01
 If that is done, you have thrown matchstick, and burning is definite.

6
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
 Everything will stick.

7
00:01:05 --> 00:01:13
 You are not interested in God only because of lack of details of knowledge of God.

8
00:01:13 --> 00:01:33
 So, here when you see the TV, you see the channels which preach the details of God,

9
00:01:33 --> 00:01:44
 and also which preach the spiritual knowledge of God, that is the real essence of God.

10
00:01:44 --> 00:01:56
 And if you see cinemas, see cinemas which are completely divine.

11
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
 Even partially divine are also good.

12
00:02:00 --> 00:02:12
 Nowadays, they are taking cinemas, the trend is everything social, now and then God, introduction.

13
00:02:12 --> 00:02:23
 Like that Hanuman picture, very one or two places only God Hanuman appears.

14
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
 Rest is social story only.

15
00:02:26 --> 00:02:35
 There also the impression on God can happen very well.

16
00:02:35 --> 00:02:46
 It is just like while eating the hot dishes, you eat the sweet dish.

17
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
 That will be very tasty, no?

18
00:02:50 --> 00:03:00
 Then continuously eating the sweet dish, that you will get bored.

19
00:03:00 --> 00:03:05
 So, such cinemas are getting good success also.

20
00:03:05 --> 00:03:19
 Now, eat continuously hot dishes, now and then you eat the sweet dish, that will have lot of impression.

21
00:03:19 --> 00:03:26
 Such trend cinemas are succeeding nowadays.

22
00:03:26 --> 00:03:38
 Completely social this picture is just like eating continuous hot dishes, that also you will get bored.

23
00:03:38 --> 00:03:44
 Completely eating sweet dishes also you will get bored.

24
00:03:44 --> 00:03:53
 So, that is why God says in Dattavedam I have written,

25
00:03:53 --> 00:04:12
 You are in the path of devotion, for some time you will be forcibly dragged to the world.

26
00:04:12 --> 00:04:23
 And you will spend some time in the world and you get bored, vexed, pained.

27
00:04:23 --> 00:04:30
 Then you will come to the God, it is just like the culvert.

28
00:04:30 --> 00:04:39
 Culvert stopping the water, flow of water, only to increase the speed of the flow of water.

29
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
 When it crosses the culvert, it brings lot of speed.

30
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
 So, you need not, that is what,

31
00:05:13 --> 00:05:18
 Narada Bhakti Sutra also the sutra says,

32
00:05:18 --> 00:05:27
 Thadarpitha khilacharatha tadvismarane paramavyakulateti

33
00:05:27 --> 00:05:39
 That is when you are dragged by Maya into the world, after some time you feel very much pained.

34
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
 Oh, I have lost God.

35
00:05:43 --> 00:05:52
 You get lot of pain and reattach to God.

36
00:05:52 --> 00:05:58
 So, that is the real devotion, that is what Sage Narada says.

37
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
 Thadvismarane paramavyakulateti

38
00:06:02 --> 00:06:10
 When you are dragged into the world from God, you will be bored with the world for some time.

39
00:06:10 --> 00:06:21
 And then when you return to God, it is just like water crossing the culvert with terrible speed.

40
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
 That is what Sage Narada told in Bhakti Sutra.

41
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
 Thadvismarane paramavyakulateti

42
00:06:29 --> 00:06:36
 That is very much suitable for this Kali Yuga, for this present day.

43
00:06:36 --> 00:06:43
 That is very much, don't worry when you are dragged into the world.

44
00:06:44 --> 00:06:55
 And when you come back from the world to God, you will get very good attachment to God.

45
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
 Very good attachment.

46
00:06:59 --> 00:07:11
 So that world, dragging to the world, dragged to the world serves like a hot dish while eating sweet dishes.

47
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
 It only increases the devotion.

48
00:07:15 --> 00:07:21
 So you need not worry, we are dragged into this world unnecessarily.

49
00:07:21 --> 00:07:27
 We have forgotten God, I have lost the time unnecessarily.

50
00:07:27 --> 00:07:36
 See, you have lost the time no doubt, but in that time the speed of the water is slow.

51
00:07:36 --> 00:07:44
 But even though you lost the time, when you get back, the speed is very much.

52
00:07:44 --> 00:07:51
 That is Sage Narada's excellent point.

53
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
 Anything more?

54
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
 Namaskaram Swami.

55
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
 Swami, you just explained about single pointed devotion.

56
00:08:05 --> 00:08:10
 Whatever God wants or wishes, concentrate 100% on that.

57
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
 My question is, what actually you want Swami, that will please you the most?

58
00:08:14 --> 00:08:20
 Is it your personal service or propagation of your spiritual knowledge or context based?

59
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
 You ask God.

60
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
 That's what it is.

61
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
 What is your message?

62
00:08:28 --> 00:08:35
 Would you like to take coffee or tea or some cool drink?

63
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
 That is what people ask.

64
00:08:39 --> 00:08:44
 What you like, I must know.

65
00:08:44 --> 00:08:49
 And I must bring that to you without asking you.

66
00:08:49 --> 00:09:00
 Without asking you, I bring coffee to you, deciding that you like coffee.

67
00:09:00 --> 00:09:12
 Then the mistake is that your intention is that coffee is liked by God, that is your intention.

68
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
 But God should like the coffee, that is the concept.

69
00:09:18 --> 00:09:30
 Whether God likes coffee or tea or green tea or something, suppose you ask God, will it not be clear?

70
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
 Is it not clear?

71
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
 What do you like?

72
00:09:39 --> 00:09:48
 One time he may like tea, another time he may like coffee, another time he may like some juice.

73
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
 Is it not?

74
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
 Context to context, that also differs.

75
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
 God will always like coffee, that is not.

76
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
 He also wants entertainment.

77
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
 He wants change.

78
00:10:02 --> 00:10:10
 He got bored with the continuous loneliness.

79
00:10:10 --> 00:10:17
 He wanted entertainment with the second item.

80
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
 Is it not?

81
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
 God also gets bored.

82
00:10:24 --> 00:10:31
 So that is not, especially in the case of contemporary human incarnation, that problem will not come.

83
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
 That problem will not come.

84
00:10:34 --> 00:10:40
 God expresses his desire completely, even before you ask.

85
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
 I tell you an example.

86
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
 Rama entered into the war.

87
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
 After the end of the first day war, Rama told Ravana,

88
00:10:59 --> 00:11:06
 you bring back Sita and give to me, I will stop the war and go back to Ayodhya.

89
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
 Then what Hanuman should have thought?

90
00:11:10 --> 00:11:15
 Hanuman is also incarnation of God Shiva.

91
00:11:15 --> 00:11:23
 God Shiva took the avatar of Hanuman, incarnation, to help Rama to kill Ravana.

92
00:11:23 --> 00:11:29
 The main purpose of Ramayana is to kill Ravana.

93
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
 Who is he troubling all?

94
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
 Is it not?

95
00:11:33 --> 00:11:37
 Then Hanuman should have thought like this.

96
00:11:37 --> 00:11:42
 This fellow Vishnu is very selfish.

97
00:11:42 --> 00:11:49
 He says that if Sita is brought, he will stop the war and go back to Ayodhya.

98
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54
 For what purpose God Vishnu took the avatar of Rama?

99
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59
 For what purpose I took the avatar of Hanuman?

100
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
 This fellow forgot everything.

101
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
 Why Rama went to forest?

102
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
 So that Ravana will steal Sita.

103
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
 So that Ravana will go and kill Ravana.

104
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
 That is the thing.

105
00:12:14 --> 00:12:19
 He forgot everything.

106
00:12:19 --> 00:12:24
 Because Rama is Manushavatar, Adarshya Manushavatar.

107
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
 He is not Leela Manushavatar like Krishna.

108
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
 He doesn't remember.

109
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
 He is immersed in the role.

110
00:12:33 --> 00:12:38
 He doesn't remember that he is the actor.

111
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
 But he is testing Hanuman.

112
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
 That is what I am telling you.

113
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
 So Hanuman should have thought like this.

114
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
 And come to Rama and told,

115
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
 Rama, you take Sita.

116
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
 Suppose he brings Sita.

117
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
 You take Sita and go back to Ayodhya.

118
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
 Tomorrow I will fight with Ravana.

119
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
 I will kill Ravana.

120
00:13:03 --> 00:13:08
 Though you are not serving the program mission,

121
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
 I will complete the mission.

122
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
 I will kill Ravana.

123
00:13:15 --> 00:13:17
 He did not say like that.

124
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
 You know, in fact, next day,

125
00:13:19 --> 00:13:24
 had Ravana brought Sita and given to Rama,

126
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
 and Rama returned back to Ayodhya,

127
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
 Hanuman will follow Rama to Ayodhya.

128
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
 He will not do the work.

129
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
 He will not fight with Ravana.

130
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
 Rama already expressed.

131
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
 You are telling that how to know.

132
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
 Even before you are asking that,

133
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
 do you like coffee, do you like tea?

134
00:13:49 --> 00:13:54
 Rama came and told, I like coffee.

135
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
 I like brew coffee.

136
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
 He announced already.

137
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
 To that distance we need not go.

138
00:14:09 --> 00:14:10
 Okay.

139
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
 Thank you, Swami.

140
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
 Then next.

141
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
 Swami, next question is from Mr. Vishnu.

142
00:14:19 --> 00:14:23
 Swami, as you said,

143
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
 listening about divine honey,

144
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
 at least while drinking coffee is the first step.

145
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
 In the same way,

146
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
 Honey is not divine nectar.

147
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
 Yes, Swami. Divine nectar,

148
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
 at least while drinking coffee is the first step.

149
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
 In the same way,

150
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
 if listening to this satsang is the first step,

151
00:14:44 --> 00:14:49
 how can people follow all the remaining steps

152
00:14:49 --> 00:14:55
 and see God who doesn't even understand this satsang in English,

153
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
 which is the first step?

154
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
 I told in Telugu.

155
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
 You are telling in English,

156
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
 we understand in Telugu,

157
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
 but English is not understood.

158
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
 That's why you are attending the satsang.

159
00:15:29 --> 00:15:30
 I don't understand anything now.

160
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
 What can I do if I attend now?

161
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
 That means,

162
00:15:37 --> 00:15:42
 for so many years I did satsangas in Telugu.

163
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
 While I was in Andhra Pradesh,

164
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
 I wrote several books.

165
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
 Several books were published in Telugu only.

166
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
 Almost all the books were published in Telugu.

167
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
 Now I thought that

168
00:16:04 --> 00:16:09
 the international language or

169
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
 world language is English.

170
00:16:13 --> 00:16:17
 For some time I served

171
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
 Telugu, my mother tongue,

172
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
 and my native state.

173
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
 I served.

174
00:16:25 --> 00:16:30
 But I should serve other states also.

175
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
 The rest part of the world I must serve.

176
00:16:36 --> 00:16:42
 And if I conduct in English,

177
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
 then even in Telugu state,

178
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
 there are several who understand English.

179
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
 In English people,

180
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
 in English there may be people

181
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
 who may not understand Telugu.

182
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
 But in Telugu state,

183
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
 there are people who can understand English.

184
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
 That is the program.

185
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
 I worked in Andhra Pradesh.

186
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
 And God Datta transferred me to English.

187
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
 He gives a transfer to some other state.

188
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
 Should the employee go or not?

189
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
 No, I will be in Andhra only.

190
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
 I will not.

191
00:17:32 --> 00:17:38
 I did a lot of service in Telugu.

192
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
 And whatever I am teaching in English,

193
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
 is already told in Telugu.

194
00:17:44 --> 00:17:49
 It is already recorded and printed in Telugu.

195
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
 Of course, I may give different examples

196
00:17:52 --> 00:17:53
 at different times.

197
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
 But concepts are same.

198
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
 Concepts, there is no loss.

199
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
 In Telugu versions also,

200
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
 I am sending everyday in the form of messages.

201
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
 All the messages, I am sending

202
00:18:08 --> 00:18:10
 whatever is written in Telugu.

203
00:18:10 --> 00:18:12
 That is also not correct.

204
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
 If you are sending in Telugu,

205
00:18:14 --> 00:18:16
 why not in Tamil?

206
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
 Why not in Hindi?

207
00:18:18 --> 00:18:20
 Why not in Punjabi?

208
00:18:20 --> 00:18:22
 Malayali?

209
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
 You see.

210
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
 English, if you want to know in Telugu,

211
00:18:35 --> 00:18:37
 you get it translated

212
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
 by an English and Telugu scholar.

213
00:18:43 --> 00:18:45
 For example, let us take

214
00:18:45 --> 00:18:51
 Rama Sundari is not entertaining much English.

215
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
 She always fights with me.

216
00:18:53 --> 00:18:59
 Swami, you are not doing justice to Telugu.

217
00:18:59 --> 00:19:03
 Like that, she fights with me.

218
00:19:03 --> 00:19:05
 But power is there.

219
00:19:05 --> 00:19:07
 She can ask her own son.

220
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
 She can ask him.

221
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
 And he can translate and tell to her.

222
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
 Instead of trying to change the source,

223
00:19:21 --> 00:19:23
 instead of saying that

224
00:19:23 --> 00:19:28
 from that station I must get railway train only,

225
00:19:28 --> 00:19:30
 I will not trial in bus.

226
00:19:31 --> 00:19:35
 You have to get down at a station by train

227
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
 and then take a bus.

228
00:19:37 --> 00:19:39
 No, no, I will not go by bus.

229
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
 From there also there must be railway line.

230
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
 That you will not do.

231
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
 General main lines or train lines are there.

232
00:19:51 --> 00:19:54
 But to some places trains are not there.

233
00:19:54 --> 00:19:56
 Buses are there.

234
00:19:56 --> 00:19:58
 You have to use bus.

235
00:20:00 --> 00:20:05
 No, no, let that train come to my place also.

236
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
 Like that you should cooperate.

237
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
 You should cooperate with the program.

238
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
 Because how can you treat me as a Telugu man?

239
00:20:26 --> 00:20:28
 That is not Telugu man.

240
00:20:28 --> 00:20:30
 He is universal.

241
00:20:30 --> 00:20:32
 Universal. He is Vishwaguru.

242
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
 He is the guru of the entire world.

243
00:20:36 --> 00:20:42
 And especially he is based on universal spirituality.

244
00:20:42 --> 00:21:00
 I don't feel anything.

245
00:21:00 --> 00:21:04
 Especially in Andhra people,

246
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
 Telugu people,

247
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
 they are not very active.

248
00:21:08 --> 00:21:14
 They are always filled with doubts.

249
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
 Any amount of spiritual knowledge you may inject into them.

250
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
 But the doubts will be coming.

251
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
 That is why in Veda it is told,

252
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
 Andha Havata Ichchandra.

253
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
 Vishwamitra says Vishwamitra is the only one who is active.

254
00:21:32 --> 00:21:35
 Andha Havata Ichchandra.

255
00:21:35 --> 00:21:40
 Vishwamitra says Vishwamitra had 100 sons.

256
00:21:40 --> 00:21:48
 And his sister is Satchavati.

257
00:21:48 --> 00:21:56
 And his son is purchased by King Harishchandra

258
00:21:56 --> 00:22:01
 to be given in sacrifice in his sacra egyam.

259
00:22:01 --> 00:22:08
 That son is taken by, he is called as Shonash Sheva.

260
00:22:08 --> 00:22:14
 He is taken by King Harishchandra.

261
00:22:14 --> 00:22:26
 On the way, he came to the ashram of Sage Vishwamitra.

262
00:22:26 --> 00:22:30
 Sage Vishwamitra had 100 sons.

263
00:22:30 --> 00:22:34
 Shonash Sheva is his maternal uncle.

264
00:22:34 --> 00:22:39
 Sage Vishwamitra is the maternal uncle of Shonash Sheva.

265
00:22:39 --> 00:22:46
 Then Shonash Sheva, Sage Vishwamitra called his 100 sons one by one.

266
00:22:46 --> 00:22:55
 My maternal, he is going to be sacrificed.

267
00:22:56 --> 00:23:03
 At least one of you go instead of him for the sacraments.

268
00:23:03 --> 00:23:10
 Then everybody refused, telling you go instead of telling Andhra.

269
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
 You go.

270
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
 Then Sage Vishwamitra cursed them.

271
00:23:16 --> 00:23:19
 Andha Havata Ichchandra.

272
00:23:19 --> 00:23:22
 You become blind.

273
00:23:22 --> 00:23:27
 They became Andhras.

274
00:23:27 --> 00:23:30
 They became Andhras.

275
00:23:30 --> 00:23:36
 See, one quality of Andhra is that, Andhra means blind.

276
00:23:36 --> 00:23:38
 Andha, blind.

277
00:23:38 --> 00:23:44
 When he goes to see a drama, he doesn't see the scenes and claps.

278
00:23:44 --> 00:23:50
 If others clap, he claps.

279
00:23:50 --> 00:23:52
 He claps at the end.

280
00:23:52 --> 00:23:56
 No, whatever I feel I am telling frankly.

281
00:23:56 --> 00:23:59
 Though I am Andhra, I am telling.

282
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
 I am not an other state person criticizing Andhras.

283
00:24:03 --> 00:24:08
 I myself am Andhra.

284
00:24:08 --> 00:24:14
 So, somehow they hear the knowledge.

285
00:24:14 --> 00:24:17
 They understand very well.

286
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
 Very, very good understanding power is there.

287
00:24:22 --> 00:24:31
 But in small, basic, small, they don't mind the loss of pumpkin fruits.

288
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
 They are very careful about mustard seeds.

289
00:24:35 --> 00:24:42
 The loss of mustard seeds, you know, when I went their houses

290
00:24:42 --> 00:24:50
 and preach spiritual knowledge for hours together for their welfare,

291
00:24:50 --> 00:24:57
 they were calculating for giving meals to me.

292
00:24:57 --> 00:25:03
 I know they did not express, but I know their minds.

293
00:25:03 --> 00:25:05
 They were calculating about the meals.

294
00:25:05 --> 00:25:13
 After all, one meal to a person, how much it costs?

295
00:25:13 --> 00:25:14
 Is it not?

296
00:25:14 --> 00:25:17
 After our eating, so much is wasted also.

297
00:25:17 --> 00:25:22
 Sometimes it is wasted.

298
00:25:22 --> 00:25:25
 They hear the knowledge for the whole day.

299
00:25:25 --> 00:25:33
 But in the night if I stay for meals, they are calculating.

300
00:25:33 --> 00:25:37
 See, I am giving divine nectar.

301
00:25:37 --> 00:25:43
 I am giving divine nectar which will create devotion in them.

302
00:25:43 --> 00:25:50
 And by that devotion, they can get mountains of wealth.

303
00:25:50 --> 00:25:55
 Mountains of wealth.

304
00:25:55 --> 00:25:58
 But they are not seeing that.

305
00:25:58 --> 00:26:04
 They are calculating the cost of the meals that is given to me.

306
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
 See, instead of preaching this knowledge to them,

307
00:26:08 --> 00:26:19
 if I preach in IIT entrance, I was an IIT entrance teacher in Narayana, Chaitanya and all that.

308
00:26:19 --> 00:26:21
 They give Nalanda.

309
00:26:21 --> 00:26:25
 They give lakhs of rupees.

310
00:26:25 --> 00:26:29
 When I resigned from a job from KLCE,

311
00:26:29 --> 00:26:39
 Narayana has sent one of his college principals to my house offering 60 lakhs per month.

312
00:26:39 --> 00:26:46
 I was recognized as specialist in energetics.

313
00:26:46 --> 00:26:52
 Energetics, there is a chapter in intermediate in IIT also.

314
00:26:52 --> 00:27:00
 He came to my house offering 60 lakhs per year.

315
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03
 I left it. I refused. You know that.

316
00:27:03 --> 00:27:09
 I refused that and dedicated myself to preach spiritual knowledge.

317
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
 That will not only give salvation to you,

318
00:27:13 --> 00:27:21
 but that also will develop devotion in you by which God is pleased to give you mountains of wealth.

319
00:27:21 --> 00:27:30
 Mountains of wealth will come by the devotion of God.

320
00:27:30 --> 00:27:35
 So that is how I got really to speak.

321
00:27:35 --> 00:27:38
 I got some aversion to Andhras.

322
00:27:38 --> 00:27:41
 These are blind people.

323
00:27:41 --> 00:27:44
 They cannot be uplifted.

324
00:27:44 --> 00:27:47
 Of course, there are some exceptions.

325
00:27:47 --> 00:27:49
 There are very good exceptions.

326
00:27:49 --> 00:27:50
 Pani is an exception.

327
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
 Ajaygarh is an exception.

328
00:27:52 --> 00:27:54
 Sharma is an exception.

329
00:27:54 --> 00:28:00
 So there are, see, everywhere there are good people and bad people.

330
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
 I don't say 100%.

331
00:28:03 --> 00:28:07
 Some good people are there. Some good people.

332
00:28:07 --> 00:28:11
 They are by mistake born in Andhra.

333
00:28:19 --> 00:28:26
 So I have published so many books in Telugu only.

334
00:28:26 --> 00:28:30
 Sanskrit and Telugu translations.

335
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
 We did not publish any book in English.

336
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 Only 10 books.

337
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40
 Only 2 lakh books were published.

338
00:28:40 --> 00:28:44
 100 varieties and 2 lakh books.

339
00:28:44 --> 00:28:50
 All books I have published in Telugu only.

340
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
 Only later on this website is in English.

341
00:28:54 --> 00:28:57
 And my speeches are in English.

342
00:28:57 --> 00:29:01
 So not like that. Don't take that as serious thing.

343
00:29:01 --> 00:29:06
 The main thing is I must not stick to a language.

344
00:29:06 --> 00:29:12
 I must spread my knowledge throughout the world as far as possible.

345
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
 Because diamonds are scattered everywhere in the world.

346
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22
 Gravel stones are segregated in every local region.

347
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
 Every place you have got gravel stones.

348
00:29:25 --> 00:29:32
 But diamonds, one diamond here, one diamond in another state, another diamond in another country.

349
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
 Diamonds are scattered.

350
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
 Gravel stones are segregated.

351
00:29:39 --> 00:29:43
 So my knowledge is always for diamonds.

352
00:29:43 --> 00:29:46
 Not for gravel stones.

353
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
 What is the use of teaching gravel stones?

354
00:29:50 --> 00:29:53
 Nothing will enter into their brain.

355
00:29:53 --> 00:30:00
 Finally after hearing the whole knowledge, what enters that brain, that gravel stone?
