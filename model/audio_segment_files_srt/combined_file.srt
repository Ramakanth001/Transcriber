9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:09
 Today we are celebrating Datta Jayanti and Swamiji today's message in Datta Jayanti's message

10
00:01:09 --> 00:01:18
 he explained about Lord Datta and Datta means that who donate himself to the world is Lord Datta

11
00:01:18 --> 00:01:28
 and our Swah, Swah he incarnate in every generation and we are so lucky that we are in this incarnation

12
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
 and we are in this contemporary incarnation with us

13
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
 this is Dattaswami why he was so special about other incarnate

14
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
 Datta means that he donated himself to all the forms

15
00:01:42 --> 00:01:47
 he donated to all the people to entire the world

16
00:01:47 --> 00:01:55
 how he donate himself, how to identify him, after identifying what to do, how to serve him

17
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
 that is the most important aspect and that is Triputti

18
00:02:00 --> 00:02:05
 that is what Swamiji in the name itself in this unique incarnation name itself is Dattaswami

19
00:02:05 --> 00:02:10
 Datta he donate for our contemporary times not the past incarnations

20
00:02:10 --> 00:02:15
 Sripaya Sivallabha, Nishamasarvaswati, Swami Samardha so many past incarnations are there

21
00:02:15 --> 00:02:22
 but still incarnation means the avatara because he come down to the unimaginable state to the imaginable state

22
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
 identifying him, how to identify him, he gives the knowledge

23
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
 by his knowledge he attracts the people

24
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
 tamjnana mohinya avatara mekam

25
00:02:32 --> 00:02:37
 Mohini avatara we know that he attracts so many people by his beauty

26
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
 Dattaswami's beauty is by his knowledge he attracts all the people

27
00:02:42 --> 00:02:48
 so he attracts the people and gives the excellent spiritual knowledge, true spiritual knowledge to the world

28
00:02:48 --> 00:02:56
 that is his primary, always incarnations comes only primary duty to give the knowledge, he is the Satguru

29
00:02:56 --> 00:03:01
 Datta means that is the incarnation who donate for us

30
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
 what is the meaning of Swami?

31
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
 Swami complete and we have to surrender to him

32
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
 the whom we completely surrender to God

33
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
 to whom we completely surrender to our contemporary human incarnation

34
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
 he is Dattaswami

35
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
 he donated for us as well as after that what we have to do?

36
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
 we have to surrender completely and serve him

37
00:03:24 --> 00:03:31
 that is the union that in this incarnation he gives excellent spiritual knowledge

38
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
 in Swami's name was Krishna also he came in the form of Krishna

39
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
 Krishna means karshigeet Krishna

40
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
 he attracts that jnana mohinya

41
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
 mohinya means with his knowledge he attracts everybody

42
00:03:44 --> 00:03:50
 within this incarnation so unique that he is giving excellent spiritual knowledge

43
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
 preaching excellent spiritual knowledge to the entire world

44
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
 not only that after identifying him we have to completely surrender

45
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
 not only surrender we have to completely sacrifice

46
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
 then this complete Dattaswami is complete then only it will complete

47
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
 that is the unique incarnation is with us

48
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
 and whenever Swami incarnates in this human form

49
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
 or energetic form whenever he incarnates every day is the Dattajayanti

50
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
 and whenever he gives the discourse

51
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
 that a new discourse comes new angle comes

52
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
 every day is Dattayanti

53
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
 specially we are celebrating that is what Swami also mentioned in Dattajayanti message

54
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
 he doesn't have any birth he is unimaginable God

55
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
 but he will come down to imagine we have to identify him

56
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
 be with him and live with him and get knowledge from him

57
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
 for giving that four bhakyatvata four fortunes

58
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
 that is why he comes down

59
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
 we are so fortunate that we are with such a human incarnation

60
00:04:48 --> 00:04:53
 this kind of knowledge never be in the past never be in the future

61
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
 why it is never be in the future?

62
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
 because kami is completely revealed everything

63
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
 nothing is left over

64
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
 that is why we are so blessed

65
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
 living with him and giving opportunity for all of us

66
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
 and thank you for Swami

67
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
 giving this great opportunity for entire mankind

68
00:05:11 --> 00:05:16
 and I will beg you to give your knowledge

69
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
 and remove our ignorance Swami

70
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
 thank you

71
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
 anybody wants to ask any questions?

72
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
 they can ask Swami ji give you answers

73
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
 any questions from anywhere even online people also can

74
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
 unmute themselves and they can ask

75
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
 and Swami you explained in Dattajayanti message

76
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
 and we have God Datta and Dattatreya

77
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
 can you differentiate between God Datta and Dattatreya?

78
00:05:54 --> 00:05:59
 I have already explained in the message

79
00:05:59 --> 00:06:03
 I have already given that answer

80
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
 Swami once more we want to hear from you directly

81
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
 generally many people mistake

82
00:06:13 --> 00:06:21
 that Datta came from Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva

83
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva

84
00:06:28 --> 00:06:33
 those three forms, divine forms

85
00:06:33 --> 00:06:38
 united and became God Datta

86
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
 it is not correct

87
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
 because Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva united

88
00:06:49 --> 00:06:59
 when Anasuya turned them into small children

89
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
 and then Anasuya asked

90
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
 the three divine forms

91
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
 God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva

92
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
 to be born as her children

93
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
 then Brahma is born as Chandra

94
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
 Vishnu is born as Dattatreya

95
00:07:26 --> 00:07:31
 and Shiva is born as Durvasa

96
00:07:31 --> 00:07:38
 then those three children united

97
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
 to form God Dattatreya

98
00:07:44 --> 00:07:49
 so this story tells us

99
00:07:49 --> 00:07:55
 that God Dattatreya came from

100
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
 God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva

101
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
 this story is correct

102
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
 but before this story

103
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
 there is another story

104
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
 which is in Bhagavatam

105
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
 Shrimad Bhagavatam

106
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
 written by Sage Vyasa

107
00:08:27 --> 00:08:35
 the story before this story was

108
00:08:35 --> 00:08:40
 Sage Atri and other sages

109
00:08:40 --> 00:08:47
 while doing spiritual discussion

110
00:08:47 --> 00:08:52
 developed a big doubt

111
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
 the doubt is

112
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
 we are going to Brahma Loka

113
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
 we are seeing the creator Brahma

114
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
 we are going to Vishnu Loka

115
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
 seeing the creator Vishnu

116
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
 we are going to Siva Loka

117
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
 seeing the destroyer God Shiva

118
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
 separately

119
00:09:21 --> 00:09:26
 these three exist

120
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
 in three separate worlds

121
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
 separately

122
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
 there are three Gods

123
00:09:37 --> 00:09:42
 Creator God, God Brahma

124
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
 Roller God, God Vishnu

125
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
 Destroyer God, God Shiva

126
00:09:48 --> 00:09:53
 when there are three Gods

127
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
 one God for creation

128
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
 one God for ruling

129
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
 and one God for destruction

130
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
 how Veda said

131
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
 that God is only one

132
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
 and that one God is doing

133
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
 creation, ruling and destruction

134
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
 Veda says

135
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
 Eka Meva Advitiya Brahma

136
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
 there is only one God

137
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
 that one God

138
00:10:31 --> 00:10:37
 is creating, ruling and destroying the world

139
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
 Kito Va Imani Bhutani Jayanti

140
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
 Ena Jatani Jeevanti

141
00:10:44 --> 00:10:49
 Yat Prayanch Abhisami Vishanti

142
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
 what we are seeing

143
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
 is just opposing

144
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
 the Vedic concept, Vedic statement

145
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
 Veda says God is one

146
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
 but we are seeing three Gods

147
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
 God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva separately

148
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
 Veda says that

149
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
 the one God

150
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
 is doing all the three cosmic activities

151
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
 creation, ruling and destruction

152
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
 but we are seeing

153
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
 God Brahma doing creation

154
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
 God Vishnu doing ruling

155
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
 and God Shiva doing destruction

156
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
 our perceptional experience

157
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
 is contradicting the Vedic statement

158
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
 this doubt, this contradiction

159
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
 doubt came to all the sages

160
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
 including Sage Atri

161
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
 Sage Atri along with his wife Anasuya

162
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
 and with all other sages

163
00:12:05 --> 00:12:10
 did long penance

164
00:12:10 --> 00:12:15
 on the mountain called Ruchha

165
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
 Ruchha Parvata

166
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
 to clarify this doubt

167
00:12:24 --> 00:12:29
 then after long penance

168
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
 the three divine forms appeared

169
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
 God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva

170
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
 all the three appeared

171
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
 and told

172
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
 you can treat

173
00:12:46 --> 00:12:51
 that all three of us as one God

174
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
 and we are doing

175
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
 all the three activities creation, ruling and destruction

176
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
 of the world

177
00:13:01 --> 00:13:06
 but Sage Atri did not agree

178
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
 he denied three, A, three

179
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
 three means three, A means no

180
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
 no three, the actual God is only one

181
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
 actual three Gods are not there

182
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
 like that Atri denied

183
00:13:28 --> 00:13:33
 that is why he became Atri

184
00:13:33 --> 00:13:38
 then these three united

185
00:13:38 --> 00:13:43
 and appeared as the original God Datta

186
00:13:43 --> 00:13:50
 what is the story of the original God Datta?

187
00:13:50 --> 00:13:55
 who is the ultimate God?

188
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
 Veda itself says that the ultimate God

189
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
 is the ultimate God

190
00:14:03 --> 00:14:08
 Veda itself says that the ultimate God

191
00:14:08 --> 00:14:13
 is not understood even by intelligence

192
00:14:13 --> 00:14:18
 that is why he is called as unimaginable God

193
00:14:18 --> 00:14:23
 by name Parabrahman

194
00:14:23 --> 00:14:28
 Parabrahman or unimaginable God

195
00:14:28 --> 00:14:34
 cannot be imagined even by intelligence

196
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
 that is why regarding Parabrahman

197
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
 what is the expression?

198
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
 silence is the expression

199
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
 because you cannot imagine

200
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
 that is what Shankara told

201
00:14:53 --> 00:14:58
 the original God, the ultimate God, the Parabrahman

202
00:14:58 --> 00:15:03
 is represented by silence

203
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
 because the God is unimaginable

204
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
 you cannot imagine

205
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
 then you cannot imagine how can you think

206
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
 how can you speak about it

207
00:15:16 --> 00:15:21
 so therefore the Parabrahman is not imagined

208
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
 you cannot think about it

209
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
 so therefore silence

210
00:15:28 --> 00:15:33
 so this original God

211
00:15:33 --> 00:15:38
 Ekaki Naramate

212
00:15:38 --> 00:15:43
 since he was only one

213
00:15:43 --> 00:15:48
 he did not get any entertainment

214
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
 he got bored

215
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
 he wanted something second

216
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
 for entertainment

217
00:15:59 --> 00:16:04
 if the second is only again one item

218
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
 he may get bored with it

219
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
 and then he may require third item

220
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
 so here

221
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
 Ekaki Naramate

222
00:16:16 --> 00:16:21
 he wanted a second item for the entertainment

223
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
 but second item means not one item

224
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
 second item is several items

225
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
 plural

226
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
 nanatma

227
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
 neha nanasthi kinchera

228
00:16:35 --> 00:16:39
 so that if one item is boring another item

229
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
 if another item is boring another item

230
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
 so the second means plurality

231
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
 multiplicity

232
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
 second means not one

233
00:16:55 --> 00:16:59
 so therefore that unimaginable God

234
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
 which is beyond imagination

235
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
 of any intelligence

236
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
 that unimaginable God

237
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
 created first some space

238
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
 space was generated from God

239
00:17:15 --> 00:17:20
 Atman Akasha Sambhootaha

240
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
 God created first space

241
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
 that first space

242
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
 created by God

243
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
 for the first time

244
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
 is called Paramayoma

245
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
 Paramayoma means absolute space

246
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
 the first space created by God

247
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
 is called absolute space

248
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
 and space means

249
00:17:54 --> 00:17:58
 inert energy, subtle inert energy

250
00:17:58 --> 00:18:02
 from that subtle energy

251
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
 Parabrahman the unimaginable God

252
00:18:06 --> 00:18:10
 created an energetic body

253
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
 body made of energy

254
00:18:13 --> 00:18:16
 and also a soul

255
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
 in that body

256
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
 soul is always energetic only

257
00:18:23 --> 00:18:27
 even our souls are energetic

258
00:18:27 --> 00:18:31
 because soul means awareness

259
00:18:31 --> 00:18:35
 awareness means nervous energy

260
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
 it is also energy

261
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
 in our case the body is matter

262
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
 materialized body

263
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
 but what Parabrahman created was

264
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
 that body is also energy

265
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
 energetic body with energetic soul

266
00:18:54 --> 00:18:57
 was created by Parabrahman

267
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
 in that the form requires some space

268
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
 for that he created space in the big body

269
00:19:04 --> 00:19:07
 created space in the beginning itself

270
00:19:07 --> 00:19:10
 which is called as Paramayoma

271
00:19:10 --> 00:19:17
 so the space occupied by that first energetic body

272
00:19:17 --> 00:19:20
 is called as Paramayoma

273
00:19:20 --> 00:19:24
 or absolute, first absolute space

274
00:19:24 --> 00:19:29
 now

275
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
 why he created this energetic being

276
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
 energetic being means body and soul

277
00:19:36 --> 00:19:39
 human being body and soul

278
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
 why he created that first energetic being

279
00:19:43 --> 00:19:48
 he measured with that energetic being

280
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
 perfectly homogeneously

281
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
 and became

282
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
 that energetic being

283
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
 became Parabrahman

284
00:20:01 --> 00:20:04
 the Parabrahman

285
00:20:04 --> 00:20:07
 measured with that energetic being

286
00:20:07 --> 00:20:13
 so that that energetic being is nothing but Parabrahman

287
00:20:13 --> 00:20:18
 Parabrahman is unimaginable

288
00:20:18 --> 00:20:23
 and this God Datta, this energetic being

289
00:20:23 --> 00:20:27
 with which Parabrahman measured

290
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
 this is called as God Datta

291
00:20:30 --> 00:20:33
 this God Datta is visible

292
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
 that is unimaginable and this is visible

293
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
 there is no difference between unimaginable Parabrahman

294
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
 and visible God Datta

295
00:20:47 --> 00:20:49
 what is the difference?

296
00:20:49 --> 00:20:53
 difference is only medium, energetic medium

297
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
 just like the best simile is

298
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
 a person who is naked in bathroom

299
00:21:00 --> 00:21:03
 not seen by anybody

300
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
 not imagined also by anybody

301
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
 came out with some dress

302
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
 now with the dress

303
00:21:13 --> 00:21:17
 the same person is visible to everybody

304
00:21:17 --> 00:21:24
 there is no difference between that naked person in the bathroom

305
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
 who is not seen by anybody

306
00:21:27 --> 00:21:36
 and the same person who came out of the bathroom with a dress

307
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
 there is no difference between those two

308
00:21:39 --> 00:21:44
 so there is no difference between unimaginable God

309
00:21:44 --> 00:21:46
 called Parabrahman

310
00:21:46 --> 00:21:51
 and the visible energetic form

311
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
 called God Datta

312
00:21:55 --> 00:22:01
 that God Datta appeared

313
00:22:01 --> 00:22:06
 now to Sage Atri and Anasuya

314
00:22:06 --> 00:22:12
 and Sage Atri and Anasuya prayed

315
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
 you please be born to us as our son

316
00:22:18 --> 00:22:27
 and God Datta was born to Sage Datta and Anasuya

317
00:22:27 --> 00:22:35
 since he was born to Sage Atri

318
00:22:35 --> 00:22:40
 he is called as Dattaatreya

319
00:22:40 --> 00:22:44
 Atreya means son of Atri

320
00:22:44 --> 00:22:52
 the same God Datta is born

321
00:22:52 --> 00:22:55
 and who is God Datta?

322
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
 the same unimaginable God

323
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
 the original unimaginable God is God Datta

324
00:23:04 --> 00:23:11
 and God Datta is born again in human forms

325
00:23:11 --> 00:23:16
 human form called Dattaatreya

326
00:23:16 --> 00:23:22
 actually God, the part of God Brahma

327
00:23:22 --> 00:23:25
 is born as Chandra

328
00:23:25 --> 00:23:31
 part of God Vishnu is born as Dattaatreya

329
00:23:31 --> 00:23:38
 and part of Shiva is born as Durvasa

330
00:23:38 --> 00:23:47
 that this Chandra gave his power

331
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
 his essence that is God Brahma to Datta

332
00:23:53 --> 00:23:59
 and this Durvasa incarnation of God Shiva

333
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
 he gave his power to this Datta, middle Datta

334
00:24:04 --> 00:24:10
 and this Chandra joined planets

335
00:24:10 --> 00:24:13
 moon is a planet

336
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
 and this Durvasa joined the sages

337
00:24:17 --> 00:24:20
 he is a sage

338
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
 since then this middle Dattaatreya

339
00:24:24 --> 00:24:31
 become the full Datta in human form

340
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
 because Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva

341
00:24:35 --> 00:24:41
 all these three are united in Dattaatreya

342
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
 that God Datta and this Dattaatreya

343
00:24:44 --> 00:24:47
 what is the difference in the form?

344
00:24:47 --> 00:24:51
 that God Datta energetic incarnation

345
00:24:51 --> 00:24:55
 is with three heads and six hands

346
00:24:55 --> 00:25:03
 this Dattaatreya is with one head and two hands

347
00:25:03 --> 00:25:11
 you have got those two forms of photos

348
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
 morning

349
00:25:14 --> 00:25:22
 all of you got two photos from Priyanka

350
00:25:22 --> 00:25:28
 one is three heads and two hands only

351
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
 three heads itself means energetic incarnation

352
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
 energy

353
00:25:36 --> 00:25:42
 only in energy you can have three heads or five heads

354
00:25:42 --> 00:25:47
 but in human form you can have only one head

355
00:25:47 --> 00:25:52
 so

356
00:25:52 --> 00:25:55
 that

357
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
 Trimukha Shatbhujha

358
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
 three faces and six hands is energetic incarnation

359
00:26:03 --> 00:26:13
 in human incarnation you can have only one head and two hands

360
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
 because energy if the material of the body is energy

361
00:26:19 --> 00:26:24
 the energy can take any type of shape

362
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
 but human form cannot take any type of shape

363
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
 only one head and two hands

364
00:26:30 --> 00:26:35
 etc

365
00:26:35 --> 00:26:36
 so

366
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
 God Datta is energetic incarnation

367
00:26:42 --> 00:26:47
 Dattaatreya is human incarnation

368
00:26:47 --> 00:26:51
 and God Datta has no birth

369
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
 since he has no birth

370
00:26:55 --> 00:27:04
 he gave himself as adopted son to Sejatri and Anasuya

371
00:27:04 --> 00:27:06
 Dattaputra

372
00:27:06 --> 00:27:11
 because he has no birth

373
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
 and this Dattaatreya is born to Anasuya

374
00:27:17 --> 00:27:20
 Dattaatreya has birth

375
00:27:20 --> 00:27:23
 now what is this Dattajayanti?

376
00:27:23 --> 00:27:28
 Dattajayanti is the date of birth of God Dattaatreya

377
00:27:28 --> 00:27:32
 who was born to Atri and Anasuya

378
00:27:32 --> 00:27:37
 not the date of birth of that original God Datta

379
00:27:37 --> 00:27:39
 who is Parabrahman

380
00:27:39 --> 00:27:42
 the first in our energetic incarnation

381
00:27:42 --> 00:27:45
 he has no parents

382
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
 he is not born

383
00:27:48 --> 00:27:55
 that God Datta is born to Atri and Anasuya

384
00:27:55 --> 00:28:01
 as human incarnation called Dattaatreya

385
00:28:01 --> 00:28:07
 so this Dattajayanti that is Marga Shersa

386
00:28:07 --> 00:28:14
 Poornima is the date of birth of God Dattaatreya

387
00:28:14 --> 00:28:19
 why there are two types of incarnations

388
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
 energetic and human incarnations

389
00:28:23 --> 00:28:31
 the energetic incarnation is relevant to energetic beings

390
00:28:31 --> 00:28:41
 in the upper worlds above earth

391
00:28:41 --> 00:28:45
 they are called as energetic worlds

392
00:28:45 --> 00:28:53
 the beings there are energetic body and energetic soul

393
00:28:53 --> 00:29:01
 for them God Datta is the relevant energetic incarnation

394
00:29:01 --> 00:29:08
 but for earth, this world, this earth

395
00:29:08 --> 00:29:13
 the relevant incarnation is human incarnation

396
00:29:13 --> 00:29:19
 what is the difference between energetic being and human being?

397
00:29:19 --> 00:29:24
 in energetic being the body is made of energy

398
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
 the soul is energy only

399
00:29:27 --> 00:29:31
 human being, the body is human body

400
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
 but the soul is energetic

401
00:29:34 --> 00:29:42
 that is the difference between energetic beings and human beings

402
00:29:42 --> 00:29:47
 so God Dattaatreya is relevant to human beings

403
00:29:47 --> 00:29:56
 and God Datta is relevant to energetic beings in the upper worlds

404
00:29:56 --> 00:30:00
 when God Parabrahman made the

405
00:30:00 --> 00:30:09
 facilities made an arrangement like this. Our foolish human beings, they go on doing

406
00:30:09 --> 00:30:23
 penance, tapas, to see that energetic form that God Datta. Lifelong penance he did,

407
00:30:23 --> 00:30:32
 God Datta appeared. Then when he will hear the knowledge from him, when he will develop

408
00:30:32 --> 00:30:47
 devotion, when he will serve him to get salvation, where is time? So there is no time, no question

409
00:30:47 --> 00:30:59
 of salvation, problem solved. There is a story, King Bhoja was invited by, you know,

410
00:30:59 --> 00:31:14
 the king, he has several wives. That day there were, with one wife, one night he goes.

411
00:31:14 --> 00:31:22
 That day, one day, from all the seven wives invitations came for him.

412
00:31:22 --> 00:31:29
 So, he was invited.

413
00:31:29 --> 00:31:44
 Kuntala Raja, Raja, his daughter, she has passed that four days menstrual period and

414
00:31:44 --> 00:31:54
 fifth days bath she has taken and invited King Bhoja to come to her house. Another

415
00:31:54 --> 00:32:05
 Magadha Raja Suta, Magadha Raja Putri, with her King Bhoja played chess and when the chess

416
00:32:06 --> 00:32:16
 played the bettino, if Bhoja is defeated, he should come to her that night. So according

417
00:32:16 --> 00:32:27
 to that, he has to go to the Antapura of Magadha Raja Putri. Then Kaushala Raja Putri, she

418
00:32:27 --> 00:32:36
 has done Satcharana and Swami Vratam and invited King Bhoja to come to her house. Like that,

419
00:32:36 --> 00:32:46
 every wife send invitation. King Bhoja was sitting, to whose house I should go? To whose

420
00:32:46 --> 00:33:01
 house I should go? In this thinking, in this diorama, the night has gone. The morning came,

421
00:33:01 --> 00:33:18
 problem is solved. No need of salvation. I am doing penance to see God. When the energetic

422
00:33:18 --> 00:33:26
 incarnation appears, it is irrelevant incarnation. It is not in the arrangement of God. God's

423
00:33:26 --> 00:33:34
 arrangement is human incarnation for humanity. This fellow did penance through all the life

424
00:33:34 --> 00:33:43
 to see God Datta. He saw God Datta. The life finished. No need of sadhana because life

425
00:33:43 --> 00:33:56
 finished. Like Bhoja has night finished. Problem solved. See, he should see God to learn the

426
00:33:56 --> 00:34:03
 true spiritual knowledge. Then after hearing true spiritual knowledge, he must develop

427
00:34:03 --> 00:34:14
 devotion on God. Then after developing devotion, he must serve God, then please God, then

428
00:34:14 --> 00:34:25
 get the salvation. To hear the true knowledge, you must see God. That is the first step.

429
00:34:26 --> 00:34:37
 For that itself, the whole life has gone. Is it not foolishness of human beings? How

430
00:34:37 --> 00:34:46
 beautiful arrangement God made. He came in human form to preach the true spiritual knowledge

431
00:34:46 --> 00:34:53
 so that you can develop devotion, you can serve God, you can please God, and finally

432
00:34:53 --> 00:35:08
 you get the ultimate salvation. There is lot of time is there. Lifetime is there. So, energetic

433
00:35:08 --> 00:35:15
 incarnation is also same God. Human incarnation is also same God. I am not denying energetic

434
00:35:15 --> 00:35:22
 incarnation. Energetic incarnation is relevant to upper energetic beings. For them he speeches

435
00:35:24 --> 00:35:41
 true spiritual knowledge. That is why God Datta confined to upper energetic worlds only

436
00:35:42 --> 00:36:03
 and God Datta is confined to this earth, humanity. And you may say, human being is he God? I

437
00:36:04 --> 00:36:11
 will ask one simple question all of you. Rama is God or not? Krishna is God or not? Are

438
00:36:13 --> 00:36:26
 they not human beings? They are God. You have problem with Sripada Vallabha, Narasimha Saraswati,

439
00:36:27 --> 00:36:34
 Manikya Prabhu, Akalakota Maharaj, Sri Sai Baba, Satcha Sai Baba, Prave Sai Baba, like

440
00:36:34 --> 00:36:45
 this. And in Gita it is clearly told, Avajananti Ma Mudhaah, Manushim Tanumashridham. When

441
00:36:46 --> 00:36:57
 I come in human form, these human beings unable to recognize me, insult me. Bhagavad Gita

442
00:36:57 --> 00:37:06
 Shloka is there. When I come in human form, Manushim Tanumashridham. Scriptural authority

443
00:37:07 --> 00:37:14
 is there. Then why should you doubt? What is the basis of your doubt? You agree Rama

444
00:37:19 --> 00:37:26
 and Krishna as human incarnations. You believe in Bhagavad Gita and that Bhagavad Gita is

445
00:37:27 --> 00:37:34
 also told by human incarnation. And you believe in Bhagavad Gita. And Bhagavad Gita is also

446
00:37:36 --> 00:37:43
 told by human incarnation. Since he is the human incarnation, he told like that. Then

447
00:37:47 --> 00:37:54
 nobody can save you. Nobody can save you. So, the reason why I am telling you this is

448
00:38:06 --> 00:38:13
 the message of Datta Jayanthi which I gave in the morning. Any questions and answers?

449
00:38:20 --> 00:38:27
 Anybody ask a question? I am Purnima Swami. So, can a newly married couple aspire to have

450
00:38:27 --> 00:38:34
 God Datta as their son? If yes, can they aspire? If yes, what is it that they need

451
00:38:46 --> 00:38:53
 to do Swami? You see, before an aspirant can aspire to have God Datta as their son, they

452
00:38:57 --> 00:39:04
 must understand one problem. If they aspire God Datta as their son, they must give a

453
00:39:12 --> 00:39:19
 share of their property to son. If they agree for this, they must give a share of their

454
00:39:27 --> 00:39:34
 property. Later on they may get some sons. But if you take one adopted son, you must

455
00:39:34 --> 00:39:41
 at least give a share of the property along with the born sons. At least share, equal

456
00:39:41 --> 00:39:48
 share. So, if they are prepared to give a share of property and if he is born, he will

457
00:39:57 --> 00:40:04
 be given a share of the property. If he is born, he will be given a share of the property.

458
00:40:05 --> 00:40:12
 That is why he is not Datta. Datta means adopted. That is why he gave to Atri and Anasuya also

459
00:40:16 --> 00:40:23
 as adopted son. That is why he is called as Datta. Dattoham. When they asked him to become

460
00:40:23 --> 00:40:30
 adopted, he said, I will give him a share of the property. So, when adoption is given,

461
00:40:30 --> 00:40:37
 the original real parents must be there to give the son for adoption. Adoption is a ritual.

462
00:40:39 --> 00:40:46
 You want to take a son, there is a Datta homam. There is a ritual. And in that ritual, that

463
00:40:47 --> 00:40:54
 boy must be given by his parents, his biological parents must give that son to this parents.

464
00:41:01 --> 00:41:08
 That is called as Datta. Genuinely he is Datta. For that he has no parents, no biological

465
00:41:08 --> 00:41:15
 parents. So, he himself gave himself as adopted son. So, he is not adopted. He is adopted.

466
00:41:16 --> 00:41:23
 He is adopted son to Atri and Anasuya. Dattoham asmi, Dattoham asmi, Dattoham asmi. He told

467
00:41:24 --> 00:41:31
 thrice. That is why he is called as Datta. That is also one reason. Another reason is

468
00:41:34 --> 00:41:41
 he is given to the world of souls for worship and meditation. That is one meaning. Another

469
00:41:41 --> 00:41:48
 meaning is when Atri and Anasuya asked him to become their son, then he told, how can

470
00:41:54 --> 00:42:01
 I become your son? My biological parents must be there. They must give me to you through

471
00:42:03 --> 00:42:10
 this Datta homam ritual. They are not there. Therefore, I am myself giving myself to the

472
00:42:11 --> 00:42:18
 world as your adopted son. He told thrice. Dattoham asmi, Dattoham asmi, Dattoham asmi.

473
00:42:19 --> 00:42:26
 Then he became the adopted son to Atri and Anasuya. Otherwise he is not Datta. So, that

474
00:42:26 --> 00:42:33
 is why understanding this problem, all the devotees reversed the policy. We are your

475
00:42:33 --> 00:42:40
 children. You are our parents. If you are not there, then you are not our father. If

476
00:43:03 --> 00:43:10
 you have some property, give to us. Our human beings are very, very intelligent. Very intelligent.

477
00:43:17 --> 00:43:24
 Today I was very happy, extremely happy with one devotee. One devotee phoned to me and

478
00:43:24 --> 00:43:31
 told, I want to use some of my gold to you because you are our Datta putra, adopted son.

479
00:43:47 --> 00:43:54
 Sudharani, mother of Trilokya. I am very happy with you. I am very happy with you. I am very

480
00:43:54 --> 00:44:01
 happy with you. I was wondering, I think she is the real devotee. Because all other devotees

481
00:44:06 --> 00:44:13
 phoned and told, we are your children. I also arranged some good finance fund so that you

482
00:44:13 --> 00:44:20
can take your shares. I felt when she phoned to me and told, I want to use some of my gold

483
00:44:20 --> 00:44:27
 because you are our Datta putra. Then I told, I am myself the adopted son of Trilokya

484
00:44:51 --> 00:44:58
 24 carats gold. Why you are thinking to give 22 carats gold? Moreover, you say that I am

485
00:45:03 --> 00:45:10
 son. I am not daughter. Only to daughter gold is given. Not son. I told all that and she

486
00:45:10 --> 00:45:17
 brought that jewel. Seeing that jewel, I feared it so much stout. It was just like

487
00:45:28 --> 00:45:35
 Ajagara snake. No, what you call? Phython. Phython type. So I asked her, what is the

488
00:45:40 --> 00:45:47
 difference between the two? She said, I am afraid of phython. You put in the bag. I will

489
00:45:54 --> 00:46:01
 take home like one devotee in the time of Akalakot Maharaj. He shows some snakes. You

490
00:46:01 --> 00:46:08
 take Ajmini snakes? You want? He is afraid. Then Maharaj says, no, you take. I am ordering

491
00:46:19 --> 00:46:26
 you. Then somehow with lot of reluctance, he caught fear. He caught snake and rounded

492
00:46:31 --> 00:46:38
 it with a towel. He took it to his home. During the journey, he was shivering. He said, see

493
00:46:43 --> 00:46:50
 when it will bite. When he took it to his house, he opened and it was golden snake.

494
00:46:50 --> 00:46:57
 He was very poor person. Swami wanted to bless him. He wanted to remove his poverty. So

495
00:47:07 --> 00:47:14
 now this phython I am taking home. I am not as deserving as that devotee. So what will

496
00:47:14 --> 00:47:21
 happen? This gold chain will become phython. When I take home and open the box, here the

497
00:47:32 --> 00:47:39
 snake became gold chain. Now this, since I am not as deserving as that devotee, when

498
00:47:40 --> 00:47:47
 I take this golden chain to my house, it will become phython. So your question need not

499
00:48:01 --> 00:48:08
 be answered because nobody will aspire.

500
00:48:09 --> 00:48:16
 So there is no problem with your question. The case is disposed with no costs. So you

501
00:48:39 --> 00:48:46
 can ask any question. Then again any other question? You translate it in English. I will

502
00:48:58 --> 00:49:05
 translate it in English. You ask in Telugu. My name is Ramasundari. My name is Ramasundari.

503
00:49:09 --> 00:49:14
 My name is Ramasundari.

504
00:49:39 --> 00:50:07
 The translation of this question is that when God Shiva could excuse Daksha by giving life

505
00:50:07 --> 00:50:19
 and by giving a new face to him, when God Shiva is so kind in the case of Daksha, why

506
00:50:19 --> 00:50:34
 he is not kind in the case of Sati? When she burnt herself, why God Shiva did not save

507
00:50:34 --> 00:50:49
 her? Such a kind Lord Shiva. That is her question. There are some differences between Sati and

508
00:50:49 --> 00:51:08
 Daksha. Sati committed suicide. Daksha was killed. There is one difference. Sati was the

509
00:51:08 --> 00:51:17
 highest devotee of God Shiva and Daksha was the highest enemy of God Shiva. That is another

510
00:51:17 --> 00:51:31
 difference. Being the highest devotee, when God Shiva advised her not to go to her father's house,

511
00:51:31 --> 00:51:46
 she neglected that word and went to the house of her father. If Daksha refused the word of Shiva,

512
00:51:46 --> 00:51:56
 there is no surprise. He is the enemy. But being the highest devotee, climax devotee,

513
00:51:59 --> 00:52:01
 in the language of Bhanu Samayikya,

514
00:52:01 --> 00:52:17
 being the climax devotee, she did not listen to the advice of God Shiva.

515
00:52:19 --> 00:52:31
 That is the greatest sin. If a non-believer is rejecting God, that is not a very big sin.

516
00:52:32 --> 00:52:42
 As per his nature, he did not listen. There is no surprise. There is no wonder. But Sati being

517
00:52:42 --> 00:52:53
 so such a devoted soul, why she rejected the advice of God Shiva and went to her father's house?

518
00:52:54 --> 00:53:04
 When God Shiva advised, it means it is not good for her to go to her father's house.

519
00:53:06 --> 00:53:12
 Why she did not think, why she did not analyze that much?

520
00:53:13 --> 00:53:22
 Daksha can be excused because he is already enemy. But Sati cannot be excused

521
00:53:25 --> 00:53:33
 being the climax devotee. Now finally what Bhanu Samayikya told is correct.

522
00:53:33 --> 00:53:40
 That is God Shiva and Sati, they acted their drama.

523
00:53:48 --> 00:53:56
 Why they acted now? Why I am not accepting it?

524
00:53:56 --> 00:54:06
 Why they acted now? Why I am appreciating that word drama? Because

525
00:54:07 --> 00:54:11
 God and climax devotees act drama

526
00:54:14 --> 00:54:21
 so that there will be a lesson to be learned by the human beings.

527
00:54:21 --> 00:54:30
 They acted drama, that is correct. But for what purpose they acted drama? Not for their purpose.

528
00:54:32 --> 00:54:44
 For the sake of the world, to know some lesson, to know some divine concept, they acted drama.

529
00:54:45 --> 00:54:46
 They acted drama.

530
00:54:49 --> 00:54:54
 So you should correct yourself. They acted their dramas, why should we bother about them?

531
00:54:55 --> 00:54:57
 For your sake only they are acting the drama.

532
00:55:04 --> 00:55:13
 You are the audience, they are actors. For whose sake drama is played? For the sake of audience.

533
00:55:15 --> 00:55:17
 So you got the answer?

534
00:55:20 --> 00:55:22
 Any other question?

535
00:55:30 --> 00:55:34
 During that process of drama, right Swami, to show us all, to show the audience,

536
00:55:35 --> 00:55:37
 there will be also suffering, no Swami.

537
00:55:37 --> 00:55:38
 There will be?

538
00:55:38 --> 00:55:38
 Suffering.

539
00:55:38 --> 00:55:40
 Suffering, actors.

540
00:55:40 --> 00:55:45
 Actors. See actors means they are acting suffering.

541
00:55:51 --> 00:55:58
 Audience only suffer. When they see cinema, they weep.

542
00:56:01 --> 00:56:03
 But the actors put a glycerin for weeping.

543
00:56:10 --> 00:56:16
 Yes, anybody else?

544
00:56:23 --> 00:56:27
 Swami, is avyaktam and sadasat, both are same Swami?

545
00:56:28 --> 00:56:32
 Are avyaktam and sadasat both same or are they different?

546
00:56:32 --> 00:56:37
 You see, avyaktam is sat.

547
00:56:40 --> 00:56:47
 Sadasat means existing, non-existing. That is the contradiction.

548
00:56:49 --> 00:56:54
 Either one thing should exist or should not exist. Is it not?

549
00:56:54 --> 00:57:18
 Sadasat, the sadasat itself is a contradiction.

550
00:57:18 --> 00:57:32
 It cannot be both sat and asat. You cannot say that this light is existing and also not existing.

551
00:57:38 --> 00:57:44
 He told in Gita, I am both sat and asat.

552
00:57:45 --> 00:57:50
 There that is different because he is omnipotent.

553
00:57:53 --> 00:57:57
 He told about himself. God told about himself.

554
00:58:01 --> 00:58:10
 There, if you analyze, that is also collaborated. How?

555
00:58:15 --> 00:58:24
 When God enters a human being and merges with him completely to become human incarnation,

556
00:58:27 --> 00:58:32
 I remain as God component. That is sat.

557
00:58:34 --> 00:58:41
 At the same time, I also become asat. What is asat here? That human being.

558
00:58:41 --> 00:58:50
 Human being is a part of the world. World is inherently non-existent.

559
00:58:54 --> 00:59:03
 So, that human being is taken as asat. By homogeneous merging with the human being component,

560
00:59:03 --> 00:59:08
 the human being component also becomes God.

561
00:59:10 --> 00:59:16
 God remains as God component. God also became the human being component.

562
00:59:18 --> 00:59:30
 So, there I am both God component as well as the human being component because of the homogeneous merging.

563
00:59:31 --> 00:59:34
 There when you analyze, it becomes correct.

564
00:59:37 --> 00:59:39
 When the fire enters the iron rod,

565
00:59:42 --> 00:59:47
 the fire is as fire is there, the iron rod also becomes fire.

566
00:59:51 --> 00:59:55
 So, I remain as sat. I also become the asat.

567
00:59:55 --> 00:59:59
 There is no difference between the human being and the asat.

568
00:59:59 --> 01:00:04
 Human being cooperated, God component there.

569
01:00:04 --> 01:00:11
 What is the purpose of human incarnation so that you can talk directly with God, you can

570
01:00:11 --> 01:00:12
 see God?

571
01:00:12 --> 01:00:13
 Is it not?

572
01:00:13 --> 01:00:20
 Unless that human being component became God, by seeing that human being component, how

573
01:00:20 --> 01:00:22
 can you say that you have seen God?

574
01:00:22 --> 01:00:25
 Unless both become one?

575
01:00:26 --> 01:00:33
 If both are not one, human being is human being, God is God, by seeing human being,

576
01:00:33 --> 01:00:39
 God is invisible, unimaginable, by seeing human being, how can you say that you have

577
01:00:39 --> 01:00:42
 seen God?

578
01:00:42 --> 01:00:48
 And when you have not seen God, what is the use of the human incarnation?

579
01:00:48 --> 01:00:56
 You wanted human incarnation to see God, to talk with God, to touch God, to live with

580
01:00:56 --> 01:00:57
 God.

581
01:00:57 --> 01:01:00
 I give you this time.

582
01:01:00 --> 01:01:09
 Unless human being became God, how can you get these four meaningful?

583
01:01:09 --> 01:01:13
 Is it not?

584
01:01:13 --> 01:01:19
 So therefore, in that context, he is both sat and asat.

585
01:01:19 --> 01:01:21
 But avyaktam you have brought that word.

586
01:01:21 --> 01:01:27
 Avyaktam means sat visible and sat invisible is avyaktam.

587
01:01:27 --> 01:01:34
 Sat visible is vyaktam, in gross state.

588
01:01:34 --> 01:01:40
 And when the same sat goes to the subtle state, it is avyaktam.

589
01:01:40 --> 01:01:43
 Sat is common.

590
01:01:43 --> 01:01:46
 You see visible light.

591
01:01:46 --> 01:01:53
 That is energy, that is invisible, that is vyaktam.

592
01:01:53 --> 01:02:02
 But the same energy goes to the invisible state like gamma rays, x-rays, etc.

593
01:02:02 --> 01:02:05
 There also the same energy is existing.

594
01:02:05 --> 01:02:10
 Sat is there, but it is invisible, avyaktam.

595
01:02:10 --> 01:02:17
 Avyaktam means invisible, existing, invisible.

596
01:02:17 --> 01:02:21
 This is existing, visible.

597
01:02:21 --> 01:02:28
 So sat stays in two stages, avyaktam and vyaktam.

598
01:02:28 --> 01:02:32
 And sat remains as sat.

599
01:02:32 --> 01:02:35
 In subtle state it is existing.

600
01:02:35 --> 01:02:38
 Gamma rays you are not seeing.

601
01:02:38 --> 01:02:44
 But gamma rays energy is existing.

602
01:02:44 --> 01:02:49
 Visible light you are seeing.

603
01:02:49 --> 01:02:51
 There also energy is existing.

604
01:02:51 --> 01:02:54
 Existence is not changing.

605
01:02:54 --> 01:02:58
 Only visible and invisible states are changing.

606
01:02:58 --> 01:03:01
 You follow?

607
01:03:01 --> 01:03:08
 Yes, there also.

608
01:03:08 --> 01:03:21
 Avyaktam yaktimapannam manyante mam abuddhaya.

609
01:03:21 --> 01:03:31
 They say that the unimaginable God, here you are referring avyaktam means unimaginable

610
01:03:31 --> 01:03:32
 God.

611
01:03:32 --> 01:03:40
 Now the point is gamma radiation is avyaktam.

612
01:03:40 --> 01:03:51
 It is avyaktam, but through some powerful microscope you can see it, it can become vyaktam.

613
01:03:51 --> 01:03:55
 You take the case of parabrahman, unimaginable God.

614
01:03:55 --> 01:04:02
 It is also avyaktam like gamma radiation for the eyes.

615
01:04:02 --> 01:04:03
 For the eyes it is not seen.

616
01:04:03 --> 01:04:05
 It is why it is avyaktam.

617
01:04:05 --> 01:04:13
 Like gamma radiation, parabrahman is also avyaktam, invisible.

618
01:04:13 --> 01:04:23
 But through microscope you can see gamma radiation, but through microscope you cannot see parabrahman.

619
01:04:23 --> 01:04:27
 But in both common is invisibility.

620
01:04:27 --> 01:04:31
 Invisibility is common, both are invisible.

621
01:04:31 --> 01:04:34
 But that parabrahman is unimaginable.

622
01:04:34 --> 01:04:38
 This gamma radiation is imaginable.

623
01:04:38 --> 01:04:44
 This gamma radiation is imaginable, invisible.

624
01:04:44 --> 01:04:49
 Parabrahman is unimaginable, invisible.

625
01:04:49 --> 01:04:52
 Common property, invisibility is there.

626
01:04:52 --> 01:04:59
 By common property you cannot say that parabrahman is gamma radiation.

627
01:04:59 --> 01:05:05
 There is differential property also, that is God is unimaginable and gamma radiation

628
01:05:05 --> 01:05:06
 is imaginable.

629
01:05:06 --> 01:05:14
 There is a differentiating factor and there is a common factor.

630
01:05:14 --> 01:05:26
 So there the sloka which you read, avyaktam yaktimapanam, I am the unimaginable God, at

631
01:05:26 --> 01:05:30
 the same time invisible also.

632
01:05:30 --> 01:05:41
 Ignorant people think that suppose the gamma radiation frequency is increased, it becomes

633
01:05:41 --> 01:05:42
 visible.

634
01:05:42 --> 01:05:52
 Now for gamma radiation parabrahman there is one commonality, that is invisibility.

635
01:05:52 --> 01:06:00
 Just like the invisible gamma radiation became the visible light, similarly the invisible

636
01:06:00 --> 01:06:04
 parabrahman became visible, people full stick like that.

637
01:06:04 --> 01:06:12
 Based on the commonality of the factor, they equalize both, but there is a differential

638
01:06:12 --> 01:06:17
 factor that God is unimaginable, gamma radiation is imaginable.

639
01:06:17 --> 01:06:20
 Are you following?

640
01:06:20 --> 01:06:34
 Abuddhaya, foolish people think that since I am invisible avyaktam, yaktimapanam, I became

641
01:06:34 --> 01:06:35
 visible.

642
01:06:35 --> 01:06:43
 Because invisible can become visible, invisible gamma radiation is becoming visible light

643
01:06:43 --> 01:06:48
 by reducing the frequency.

644
01:06:48 --> 01:06:58
 Like that, myself parabrahman also invisible became visible, that is what fools think.

645
01:06:58 --> 01:07:05
 Based on the commonality factor, both are invisible, but there is a differential factor.

646
01:07:05 --> 01:07:09
 I am unimaginable, that is imaginable.

647
01:07:09 --> 01:07:14
 So I will not become visible.

648
01:07:14 --> 01:07:17
 I will never become visible.

649
01:07:17 --> 01:07:26
 Nobody can see God with eyes, even with mind.

650
01:07:26 --> 01:07:56
 When that unimaginable and invisible God gets mediated, I am become visible.

651
01:07:57 --> 01:08:01
 No, that you should not apply.

652
01:08:01 --> 01:08:06
 He got mediated and appeared.

653
01:08:06 --> 01:08:07
 Mediated and appeared.

654
01:08:07 --> 01:08:08
 Not reduced the frequency.

655
01:08:08 --> 01:08:12
 That you can apply to gamma radiation.

656
01:08:12 --> 01:08:15
 Not to God.

657
01:08:15 --> 01:08:19
 God here became visible.

658
01:08:20 --> 01:08:22
 Understand?

659
01:08:22 --> 01:08:25
 Your wife is sleeping.

660
01:08:33 --> 01:08:45
 So there, the unimaginable God became visible not due to reduction of frequency like gamma

661
01:08:45 --> 01:08:49
 radiation becoming visible light.

662
01:08:50 --> 01:08:53
 He became visible due to mediation.

663
01:08:53 --> 01:09:01
 Because the unimaginable God is non-mediated, he is invisible and he is unimaginable.

664
01:09:01 --> 01:09:06
 That unimaginable God became mediated.

665
01:09:06 --> 01:09:09
 Therefore I am seen.

666
01:09:13 --> 01:09:17
 That is the meaning of kashin man veg tattvatah.

667
01:09:20 --> 01:09:25
 Kashin man veg tattvatah means one understands me, one sees me.

668
01:09:25 --> 01:09:30
 Does not mean that one can see the unimaginable God.

669
01:09:30 --> 01:09:35
 That does not mean that one can understand the unimaginable God.

670
01:09:35 --> 01:09:45
 That means the unimaginable God who got mediated himself and appeared is the same unimaginable

671
01:09:45 --> 01:09:46
 God and mediated.

672
01:09:46 --> 01:09:49
 Like that he understands.

673
01:09:50 --> 01:09:51
 Kashin man veg tattvatah.

674
01:09:51 --> 01:09:54
 He understands me as parabrahman.

675
01:09:56 --> 01:10:01
 Because there I was unmediated, here I am mediated.

676
01:10:04 --> 01:10:13
 A naked fellow in the bathroom is wrapped by dress, came out and is seen by people.

677
01:10:14 --> 01:10:23
 The same naked person condensed himself into a clothed person and came out.

678
01:10:23 --> 01:10:25
 That is another thing.

679
01:10:31 --> 01:10:32
 You follow?

680
01:10:32 --> 01:10:33
 Yes.

681
01:10:33 --> 01:10:34
 All of you understand?

682
01:10:34 --> 01:10:37
 Swami in continuation.

683
01:10:40 --> 01:10:45
 When unimaginable is already discussed, why is it again talking about invisible?

684
01:10:45 --> 01:10:49
 When it is not imaginable, why talking about invisibility, Swami?

685
01:10:49 --> 01:10:52
 You talk slowly, first let me understand.

686
01:10:52 --> 01:10:55
 If you talk fast I cannot understand.

687
01:10:55 --> 01:11:01
 When you said it is unimaginable, God is unimaginable, unimaginable means like you cannot imagine anything.

688
01:11:01 --> 01:11:02
 Yes.

689
01:11:03 --> 01:11:06
 Why do we say invisible when you already used unimaginable?

690
01:11:08 --> 01:11:13
 Because we have brought gamma radiation in comparison.

691
01:11:13 --> 01:11:17
 Gamma radiation is imaginable and invisible.

692
01:11:19 --> 01:11:22
 Parabrahman is unimaginable and invisible.

693
01:11:23 --> 01:11:32
 To show that commonality factor, I added this visible word to parabrahman also.

694
01:11:33 --> 01:11:38
 Then only I can compare gamma radiation with the unimaginable God.

695
01:11:41 --> 01:11:43
 What is the commonality factor?

696
01:11:43 --> 01:11:45
 Both are invisible.

697
01:11:45 --> 01:11:48
 Then shall I use the word invisible for parabrahman also or not?

698
01:11:51 --> 01:11:54
 Hrusheekeshi is red in color.

699
01:11:54 --> 01:11:57
 Kartikey is also red in color.

700
01:11:58 --> 01:12:03
 Then, no, no, you should not say Hrusheekeshi is red in color.

701
01:12:03 --> 01:12:06
 Like that how can you say?

702
01:12:07 --> 01:12:14
 To show the commonality, I am telling Hrusheekeshi is red, Kartikey is red.

703
01:12:15 --> 01:12:18
 No, no, you say Kartikey is red but not Hrusheekeshi.

704
01:12:21 --> 01:12:25
 Unless I say both, how can I show commonality?

705
01:12:26 --> 01:12:29
 Today's satsang is very deep.

706
01:12:43 --> 01:12:49
 Swami, there are questions from online. Shall I read, Swami?

707
01:12:49 --> 01:12:51
 Yes, yes.

708
01:12:52 --> 01:12:55
 This question is from Manikanta.

709
01:12:55 --> 01:13:00
 If unimaginable God is avyaktam, how can we say He exists?

710
01:13:02 --> 01:13:04
 How can we say He exists?

711
01:13:04 --> 01:13:15
 He exists because He got mediated and He is performing miracles.

712
01:13:15 --> 01:13:24
 See, the same unimaginable God became imaginable and visible.

713
01:13:24 --> 01:13:34
 The same unimaginable and invisible God became imaginable and visible by getting mediated.

714
01:13:35 --> 01:13:45
 The unimaginable miracles, the source of unimaginable miracles can be only unimaginable God.

715
01:13:45 --> 01:13:51
 And when the mediated God also is doing the same miracles,

716
01:13:51 --> 01:14:02
 that means the same unmediated God, unimaginable God, became the mediated, imaginable and visible God.

717
01:14:03 --> 01:14:10
 Because of the commonality of the unimaginable events called miracles in both of them.

718
01:14:11 --> 01:14:15
 Now here, one more correlation also can be given.

719
01:14:16 --> 01:14:29
 The fellow who was taking bath in the bathroom, he came, he finished bath and he got himself dressed and came out.

720
01:14:30 --> 01:14:36
 When he came out, still some parts of his body are visible.

721
01:14:37 --> 01:14:45
 That same naked fellow's parts, the legs are visible, the face is visible, the hands are visible.

722
01:14:46 --> 01:14:54
 So, even the same unimaginable God became visible partially.

723
01:14:55 --> 01:15:02
 Because the dress cannot completely cover from top to legs, then people will run away.

724
01:15:03 --> 01:15:12
 When Jesus told Lazarus, come out, come out, then he came out all wrapped with cloth, you know.

725
01:15:12 --> 01:15:14
 Nothing is seen.

726
01:15:15 --> 01:15:16
 Not like that.

727
01:15:17 --> 01:15:22
 He came with pants, a lungi and a shirt, hands are seen.

728
01:15:22 --> 01:15:25
 Hands are seen, feet are seen.

729
01:15:26 --> 01:15:31
 So even though he got mediated, some original part is seen.

730
01:15:32 --> 01:15:33
 What is that part?

731
01:15:34 --> 01:15:38
 That is the unimaginable events called miracles.

732
01:15:43 --> 01:15:49
 Partly he is seen, his legs are seen, his face is seen, his hands are seen.

733
01:15:50 --> 01:15:57
 Some unimaginable portion of unimaginable God becomes also visible.

734
01:15:59 --> 01:16:07
 And that portion which becomes visible is the unimaginable miracle done by God Datta.

735
01:16:14 --> 01:16:16
 So what is the question?

736
01:16:17 --> 01:16:24
 If unimaginable God is avyaktam, how can we say he exists?

737
01:16:25 --> 01:16:26
 Ah, exists.

738
01:16:27 --> 01:16:38
 You see, the characteristic of unimaginable God is performing unimaginable event.

739
01:16:39 --> 01:16:46
 That is the characteristic of unimaginable God.

740
01:16:47 --> 01:16:52
 The unimaginable God became imaginable God by mediation.

741
01:16:53 --> 01:16:56
 And he is performing the same miracle.

742
01:16:59 --> 01:17:06
 This miracle gives the clue of the existence of unimaginable God.

743
01:17:09 --> 01:17:11
 That is called as inference.

744
01:17:12 --> 01:17:14
 Anumana pramana.

745
01:17:15 --> 01:17:17
 It is based on prachacha pramana.

746
01:17:18 --> 01:17:24
 That is, we have seen the unimaginable events performed by unimaginable God.

747
01:17:25 --> 01:17:33
 The same unimaginable events are also seen in this imaginable God, visible God.

748
01:17:34 --> 01:17:41
 Therefore that unimaginable God must be existing in this mediated God, mediated person.

749
01:17:42 --> 01:17:48
 Just like you have seen in the kitchen that smoke is coming from fire.

750
01:17:51 --> 01:17:55
 There you have seen both fire and smoke.

751
01:17:56 --> 01:18:00
 Now you are going, from the top of the hill some smoke is coming.

752
01:18:00 --> 01:18:13
 Based on your perception knowledge in the kitchen, now you will say since smoke is coming, there must be fire on the hill.

753
01:18:14 --> 01:18:21
 The knowledge that is attained by inference is called as induction.

754
01:18:22 --> 01:18:27
 The knowledge that is attained from perception is called as deduction.

755
01:18:28 --> 01:18:37
 Based on the deduction, that is, you have seen smoke coming from the fire in the kitchen.

756
01:18:38 --> 01:18:42
 Then you will have vyapti, that is generalization.

757
01:18:43 --> 01:18:45
 Wherever there is smoke, there must be fire.

758
01:18:46 --> 01:18:49
 Now you have seen smoke from the hill.

759
01:18:50 --> 01:18:52
 You are not seeing fire.

760
01:18:53 --> 01:19:02
 But based on the generalization of the deduction, your induction conclusion is that there is fire on the hill.

761
01:19:05 --> 01:19:13
 So not only perception is a proof for existence, but inference is also a proof for existence.

762
01:19:23 --> 01:19:25
 Yes, Swami.

763
01:19:28 --> 01:19:31
 Swami, there is one more question from online. Shall I read, Swami?

764
01:19:33 --> 01:19:36
 The following question is from Ms. Amudha.

765
01:19:37 --> 01:19:39
 Pada Namaskaran, Swami.

766
01:19:40 --> 01:19:48
 What is moksha? Love for God is moksha or basic self-love is moksha or both?

767
01:19:49 --> 01:19:50
 Both.

768
01:19:57 --> 01:20:04
 See, moksha means, simple direct meaning of moksha is liberation.

769
01:20:07 --> 01:20:16
 When you are bound by something, suppose you are bound by a rope and somebody came and cut the rope.

770
01:20:17 --> 01:20:19
 You got moksha from the rope.

771
01:20:20 --> 01:20:24
 Moksha means liberation, simply liberation.

772
01:20:25 --> 01:20:29
 You can use that word in any context.

773
01:20:30 --> 01:20:32
 I got liberation from the rope.

774
01:20:34 --> 01:20:37
 I got liberation from this husband.

775
01:20:39 --> 01:20:40
 That is also moksha?

776
01:20:40 --> 01:20:45
 Yes, Maya, I got moksha from my husband.

777
01:20:48 --> 01:20:50
 Moksha means simply liberation.

778
01:20:53 --> 01:20:57
 If you love both yourself and God, where is moksha?

779
01:21:00 --> 01:21:01
 It's not.

780
01:21:02 --> 01:21:14
 So, the person who loves himself is liberated from God. That is moksha.

781
01:21:19 --> 01:21:23
 The person who loves God is liberated from himself.

782
01:21:24 --> 01:21:25
 That is moksha.

783
01:21:26 --> 01:21:28
 So there are two types of moksha.

784
01:21:29 --> 01:21:31
 Whichever you like, you have.

785
01:21:32 --> 01:21:33
 Who objected?

786
01:21:34 --> 01:21:39
 Indian constitution has given freedom, fundamental rights, freedom.

787
01:21:40 --> 01:21:42
 Seven fundamental rights are given.

788
01:21:43 --> 01:21:48
 Freedom of speech, freedom of expression, like that.

789
01:21:49 --> 01:21:52
 So if you want freedom from varayad.

790
01:21:53 --> 01:22:01
 One thing, if you get freedom from one thing, you will get attachment to another thing.

791
01:22:02 --> 01:22:04
 Attachment means yoga.

792
01:22:05 --> 01:22:12
 Yoga, actual translation is union, attainment.

793
01:22:13 --> 01:22:14
 That is yoga.

794
01:22:15 --> 01:22:17
 Moksha means liberation.

795
01:22:18 --> 01:22:19
 Moksha means liberation.

796
01:22:20 --> 01:22:22
 Attainment of God, if you want.

797
01:22:24 --> 01:22:29
 You liberate yourself from all the worldly bonds, including yourself.

798
01:22:30 --> 01:22:33
 You are bonded to yourself, love of myself.

799
01:22:34 --> 01:22:36
 That is also a worldly bond.

800
01:22:41 --> 01:22:44
 That also one has to get liberation.

801
01:22:44 --> 01:22:48
 When Krishna died, all gopikas jumped into fire.

802
01:22:50 --> 01:22:52
 That means they got liberation from themselves.

803
01:22:54 --> 01:22:57
 From that I, they got liberation.

804
01:22:58 --> 01:23:00
 That is why they jumped into fire.

805
01:23:02 --> 01:23:07
 Ramakrishna Brahman, he could not see mother Kali.

806
01:23:08 --> 01:23:18
 He was trying very much tortured because mother did not appear.

807
01:23:19 --> 01:23:21
 Then he jumped on a knife.

808
01:23:22 --> 01:23:24
 Then mother appeared.

809
01:23:25 --> 01:23:29
 He jumped on knife means he got liberation from himself.

810
01:23:30 --> 01:23:34
 From the love of himself, love of I.

811
01:23:35 --> 01:23:37
 From that also he got liberation.

812
01:23:38 --> 01:23:40
 Then only he jumped.

813
01:23:41 --> 01:23:46
 He tried to sacrifice his life, that is himself, for the sake of God.

814
01:23:49 --> 01:23:58
 So all the worldly bonds, liberation from all the worldly bonds is necessary to attain God.

815
01:23:59 --> 01:24:04
 But the actual concept is that

816
01:24:09 --> 01:24:17
 instead of you forcibly trying to liberate yourself from the worldly bonds,

817
01:24:20 --> 01:24:26
 better you attach to God so that worldly bonds themselves will drop.

818
01:24:29 --> 01:24:31
 That is very easy.

819
01:24:32 --> 01:24:34
 There is no need of any strain.

820
01:24:37 --> 01:24:41
 Instead of leaving wife and children by fighting,

821
01:24:42 --> 01:24:47
 suppose you are always immersed in God, they will themselves leave you.

822
01:24:49 --> 01:24:52
 They will put you in your room lock and then go to cinema.

823
01:24:55 --> 01:24:57
 They themselves drop.

824
01:24:58 --> 01:25:00
 You need not put any effort.

825
01:25:02 --> 01:25:05
 Just like the Sardar came inside, goat went outside.

826
01:25:11 --> 01:25:13
 You know that joke?

827
01:25:14 --> 01:25:15
 Sardar and goat joke.

828
01:25:16 --> 01:25:18
 You don't know?

829
01:25:20 --> 01:25:22
 See, one goat was kept in a room.

830
01:25:22 --> 01:25:28
 And from each state, one person is sent into the room.

831
01:25:29 --> 01:25:34
 How many minutes this fellow can bear the smell of the goat?

832
01:25:36 --> 01:25:38
 One list is prepared.

833
01:25:39 --> 01:25:42
 Andhra Pradesh fellow went, 10 minutes he could bear.

834
01:25:43 --> 01:25:47
 Telangana person went, some 12 minutes he could bear.

835
01:25:48 --> 01:25:52
 Manjap Pradesh person went, 15 minutes he could bear.

836
01:25:53 --> 01:25:55
 Some list is being prepared.

837
01:25:56 --> 01:26:01
 But when Sardar, Punjab, when Sardar went inside, the goat came outside.

838
01:26:05 --> 01:26:09
 Now these judges went to the chairman and asked him,

839
01:26:10 --> 01:26:12
 what value we have to put?

840
01:26:13 --> 01:26:15
 For that fellow, 10 minutes.

841
01:26:16 --> 01:26:18
 For this fellow, 12 minutes.

842
01:26:19 --> 01:26:21
 For this fellow, 15 minutes.

843
01:26:22 --> 01:26:24
 For Sardar, how many minutes we have to put?

844
01:26:31 --> 01:26:35
 That joke has got a lot of importance in spiritual knowledge.

845
01:26:36 --> 01:26:41
 You can learn the real clue of salvation from that joke.

846
01:26:44 --> 01:26:47
 No, don't fight with family members.

847
01:26:49 --> 01:26:51
 Get yourself immersed in God always.

848
01:26:52 --> 01:26:57
 You have tasted His sweetness of God.

849
01:26:58 --> 01:27:00
 And you are immersed in God.

850
01:27:01 --> 01:27:03
 The sweetness of God.

851
01:27:04 --> 01:27:06
 And you are immersed in God.

852
01:27:07 --> 01:27:09
 The devasas will leave you.

853
01:27:10 --> 01:27:12
 No need of fighting, no need of quarrel.

854
01:27:15 --> 01:27:17
 Spontaneously drop out.

855
01:27:20 --> 01:27:24
 How is for salvation, this is the easiest method.

856
01:27:24 --> 01:27:26
 Get detachment by attachment.

857
01:27:27 --> 01:27:32
 You will always get real detachment by another real attachment.

858
01:27:33 --> 01:27:35
 Suppose you are seeing cinema.

859
01:27:36 --> 01:27:41
 You are so much attached and immersed in the cinema that even mosquitoes bite you.

860
01:27:42 --> 01:27:45
 Even the blood bugs swallow your blood.

861
01:27:46 --> 01:27:48
 You are not aware.

862
01:27:49 --> 01:27:51
 Detach from all those things.

863
01:27:52 --> 01:27:54
 Because of your attachment in the cinema.

864
01:27:56 --> 01:28:01
 Always real detachment comes from only another real attachment.

865
01:28:03 --> 01:28:08
 Without another real attachment, you cannot get real detachment.

866
01:28:10 --> 01:28:12
 You have tasted the divine nectar.

867
01:28:14 --> 01:28:16
 Then coffee dropped by itself.

868
01:28:17 --> 01:28:20
 Even if somebody forces you to drink coffee.

869
01:28:21 --> 01:28:23
 No, no, I don't like coffee.

870
01:28:24 --> 01:28:30
 But without tasting divine nectar, you leave coffee by force.

871
01:28:31 --> 01:28:33
 Some four days you can leave.

872
01:28:34 --> 01:28:36
 Fifth day one bucket of coffee you will drink.

873
01:28:39 --> 01:28:46
 So we can say it is impossible to get real detachment without another real attachment.

874
01:28:47 --> 01:28:49
 It is impossible.

875
01:28:50 --> 01:28:52
 Not only impossible, but also waste.

876
01:28:53 --> 01:28:57
 Because I am leaving coffee.

877
01:28:59 --> 01:29:04
 And leaving coffee is not a prerequisite to get divine nectar.

878
01:29:05 --> 01:29:09
 If you want to get divine nectar, you must leave coffee. There is no rule.

879
01:29:11 --> 01:29:15
 So by leaving coffee you are not getting divine nectar.

880
01:29:16 --> 01:29:18
 It is not a prerequisite rule.

881
01:29:19 --> 01:29:21
 Then what happens?

882
01:29:22 --> 01:29:25
 You have lost both coffee and divine nectar.

883
01:29:26 --> 01:29:28
 At least have coffee.

884
01:29:29 --> 01:29:31
 If divine nectar is not updated.

885
01:29:32 --> 01:29:40
 At least have coffee because the mind has got one terrible quality that it should be attached to something always.

886
01:29:41 --> 01:29:47
 Without attachment to anything the mind cannot stay alone.

887
01:29:48 --> 01:29:56
 Therefore it is impossible to get detachment without another attachment.

888
01:29:57 --> 01:29:59
 Mind will rebel.

889
01:29:59 --> 01:30:03
 I want some attachment.

890
01:30:03 --> 01:30:09
 If you detach yourself to coffee, attach myself to God.

891
01:30:09 --> 01:30:14
 Some attachment I want.

892
01:30:14 --> 01:30:17
 You cannot control mind when it rebels.

893
01:30:17 --> 01:30:24
 If you are like a gentleman, then it will be also like a gentleman.

894
01:30:24 --> 01:30:26
 If you rebel, no, no.

895
01:30:26 --> 01:30:28
 Be detached from everything.

896
01:30:28 --> 01:30:29
 No, it will rebel.

897
01:30:31 --> 01:30:32
 You will be defeated by mind.

898
01:30:36 --> 01:30:37
 So what is the question?

899
01:30:37 --> 01:30:38
 I forget.

900
01:30:40 --> 01:30:41
 For what I have given the answer.

901
01:30:43 --> 01:30:45
 So Swami, the question is like this.

902
01:30:45 --> 01:30:46
 What is moksha?

903
01:30:46 --> 01:30:49
 And you are by loving God.

904
01:30:49 --> 01:30:50
 Loving God is moksha.

905
01:30:51 --> 01:30:52
 So I have given the answer.

906
01:30:54 --> 01:30:55
 I have given the answer.

907
01:30:55 --> 01:30:56
 Yes, Swami.

908
01:30:56 --> 01:30:57
 Yes, any question?

909
01:30:57 --> 01:30:58
 Yes, Swami.

910
01:30:58 --> 01:30:59
 One more question, Swami.

911
01:30:59 --> 01:31:00
 This question is from Mr. Aravind.

912
01:31:00 --> 01:31:01
 Namaskaran, Swami.

913
01:31:01 --> 01:31:10
 Being an ordinary mortal coiled in worldly wants, will we get a chance to ever witness

914
01:31:10 --> 01:31:19
 God like how Swami Ramakrishna showed us the divine power of God?

915
01:31:19 --> 01:31:27
 To ever witness God like how Swami Ramakrishna showed Swami Vivekananda?

916
01:31:27 --> 01:31:29
 Again, you repeat.

917
01:31:29 --> 01:31:33
 In the earlier part, I did not catch.

918
01:31:33 --> 01:31:36
 Okay, so I will repeat the question, Swami.

919
01:31:36 --> 01:31:48
 Being an ordinary mortal coiled in worldly wants, will we get a chance to ever witness

920
01:31:48 --> 01:31:57
 God like how Swami Ramakrishna showed Swami Vivekananda?

921
01:31:57 --> 01:32:09
 You see, I understood the spirit of the question.

922
01:32:09 --> 01:32:27
 Can we taste divine nectar when I am drinking coffee for every one hour in the day?

923
01:32:27 --> 01:32:31
 Every one hour I need a cup of coffee.

924
01:32:31 --> 01:32:34
 Can I taste that divine nectar?

925
01:32:34 --> 01:32:36
 That is the question.

926
01:32:39 --> 01:32:42
 Yes, you can taste.

927
01:32:42 --> 01:32:43
 How?

928
01:32:43 --> 01:32:47
 There is a procedure.

929
01:32:47 --> 01:32:55
 To taste the divine nectar, you must have the complete knowledge of the divine nectar.

930
01:32:55 --> 01:32:59
 You don't know that divine nectar exists.

931
01:32:59 --> 01:33:01
 How can this question come?

932
01:33:01 --> 01:33:12
 Even if you don't know, you are so much immersed in coffee that you never heard about divine nectar,

933
01:33:12 --> 01:33:15
 then it is not possible.

934
01:33:15 --> 01:33:17
 When it becomes possible?

935
01:33:17 --> 01:33:25
 When you get total knowledge of the divine nectar, then you will get interest.

936
01:33:25 --> 01:33:29
 See, knowledge generates interest.

937
01:33:29 --> 01:33:32
 First you must try for knowledge.

938
01:33:32 --> 01:33:35
 How is Mumbai city?

939
01:33:35 --> 01:33:41
 You must hear what are the special things that can be seen in Mumbai city.

940
01:33:41 --> 01:33:46
 If I go to Mumbai city, what are the attractive things?

941
01:33:46 --> 01:33:53
 You must get the knowledge of Mumbai, the details of Mumbai city from somebody.

942
01:33:53 --> 01:33:59
 Then by hearing that knowledge, you will develop interest.

943
01:33:59 --> 01:34:03
 That interest is called as devotion.

944
01:34:03 --> 01:34:07
 So knowledge generates devotion.

945
01:34:07 --> 01:34:11
 Gnana Yoga liberates Bhakti Yoga.

946
01:34:11 --> 01:34:15
 Gnana Yoga develops Bhakti Yoga.

947
01:34:15 --> 01:34:19
 Unless you hear, how can you develop interest?

948
01:34:19 --> 01:34:22
 Interest is the devotion.

949
01:34:22 --> 01:34:26
 Interest is the inspiration.

950
01:34:26 --> 01:34:32
 Then when you develop devotion, then you will make a triumph.

951
01:34:32 --> 01:34:34
 You will go to the railway station.

952
01:34:34 --> 01:34:36
 You will walk to the railway station.

953
01:34:36 --> 01:34:38
 That is called as Karma Sanyasa.

954
01:34:38 --> 01:34:42
 You will take money and purchase tickets for Mumbai.

955
01:34:42 --> 01:34:45
 That is Karma Phalak Tyaga.

956
01:34:45 --> 01:34:49
 So hearing the details of Mumbai city is Gnana Yoga.

957
01:34:49 --> 01:34:53
 Developing interest to see Mumbai city is Bhakti Yoga.

958
01:34:53 --> 01:34:57
 Walking up to railway station is Karma Sanyasa Yoga.

959
01:34:57 --> 01:35:05
 And taking money from the pocket and purchasing ticket for Mumbai is Karma Phalak Tyaga Yoga.

960
01:35:05 --> 01:35:09
 These four steps must take place.

961
01:35:09 --> 01:35:16
 Then definitely you will taste divine nectar and leave the coffee.

962
01:35:17 --> 01:35:21
 It is possible, provided you follow the procedure.

963
01:35:21 --> 01:35:25
 So first what step you must take?

964
01:35:25 --> 01:35:31
 First step is stop the drinking of coffee for some time

965
01:35:31 --> 01:35:36
 and hear about divine nectar at least here.

966
01:35:36 --> 01:35:40
 Or at least while taking coffee here.

967
01:35:46 --> 01:35:52
 Without that first step, can I see God?

968
01:35:52 --> 01:35:57
 First step is not possible.

969
01:35:57 --> 01:36:04
 We are not developing real interest even to hear the details of God.

970
01:36:04 --> 01:36:08
 When we open TV, we see only cinemas.

971
01:36:08 --> 01:36:14
 We don't see Samskar channel or Astha channel

972
01:36:14 --> 01:36:24
 in which divine things, stories about God and praise about God is told.

973
01:36:24 --> 01:36:29
 We don't have time to see Samskar channel.

974
01:36:29 --> 01:36:34
 And we ask, can I have a chance to meet God?

975
01:36:34 --> 01:36:39
 Even to hear the details of God, you don't have time.

976
01:36:39 --> 01:36:45
 Time, you don't have minimum interest.

977
01:36:45 --> 01:36:50
 How can you think of the result?

978
01:36:50 --> 01:36:55
 Dr. Geetha Lahari.

979
01:36:55 --> 01:36:59
 Am I correct?

980
01:36:59 --> 01:37:03
 The patient doesn't come to the hospital.

981
01:37:03 --> 01:37:08
 He wants perfect health.

982
01:37:08 --> 01:37:12
 Is it possible?

983
01:37:12 --> 01:37:27
 One thing I am telling all of you, very seriously.

984
01:37:27 --> 01:37:37
 In so simple way,

985
01:37:37 --> 01:37:42
 in so enlightened way,

986
01:37:42 --> 01:37:52
 I have not preached the spiritual knowledge in any incarnation.

987
01:37:52 --> 01:37:54
 Still,

988
01:37:54 --> 01:38:02
 I have not preached the spiritual knowledge in any incarnation.

989
01:38:02 --> 01:38:06
 Tomorrow when they come to hell,

990
01:38:06 --> 01:38:09
 Sir, we don't know all this.

991
01:38:09 --> 01:38:13
 Nobody told us.

992
01:38:13 --> 01:38:19
 Had we known, we would have pierced.

993
01:38:19 --> 01:38:26
 You have pierced the spiritual knowledge.

994
01:38:26 --> 01:38:42
 My responsibility is over.

995
01:38:42 --> 01:38:46
 I know that whether I preach or not preach,

996
01:38:46 --> 01:38:48
 the result is going to be same.

997
01:38:48 --> 01:38:50
 That I know very well.

998
01:38:50 --> 01:38:55
 But still I am preaching so that tomorrow you will not say in the hell,

999
01:38:55 --> 01:38:58
 Sir, we don't know about this thing.

1000
01:38:58 --> 01:39:04
 Had we known, we would have moved the mountains.

1001
01:39:04 --> 01:39:09
 Due to ignorance, we could not do this.

1002
01:39:09 --> 01:39:13
 To escape.

1003
01:39:13 --> 01:39:19
 Instead of getting rid of that blame,

1004
01:39:19 --> 01:39:49
 I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

1005
01:39:49 --> 01:39:56
 am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

1006
01:39:56 --> 01:40:03
 am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

1007
01:40:03 --> 01:40:10
 am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

1008
01:40:10 --> 01:40:17
 am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

1009
01:40:17 --> 01:40:24
 will be more and more disqualified and that post will go more and more far. It is only

1010
01:40:27 --> 01:40:34
 disqualifies. It only disqualifies. Instead of that you can say, I want to preach some

1011
01:40:37 --> 01:40:44
 good spiritual knowledge to the humanity and help them in their salvation. That much is

1012
01:40:47 --> 01:40:54
 enough. That much you can think. Then God will automatically make you incarnation. But

1013
01:40:55 --> 01:41:02
 starting itself, I want to make him incarnation. The liking is for the child, not for the responsibility.

1014
01:41:02 --> 01:41:09
 Our always accompany the responsibilities. There is a saying, ours always accompany the

1015
01:41:21 --> 01:41:28
 responsibilities. So you think of the responsibility. Do not think of the power. If you think that

1016
01:41:29 --> 01:41:36
 I want to become human incarnation, that means you are aspiring for power, not responsibility.

1017
01:41:36 --> 01:41:43
 Suppose you think, I want to serve the humanity, I want to help some human beings from the

1018
01:41:46 --> 01:41:53
 ignorance and lead them to the true spiritual knowledge, to the true path to God, I want

1019
01:41:53 --> 01:42:00
 to help. That is responsibility. If you think responsibility, power will be given. If you

1020
01:42:02 --> 01:42:09
 think power, you will be moved far and far from the position. Follow?

1021
01:42:14 --> 01:42:20
 What can we do to not to sprout that idea of getting incarnation, Swami?

1022
01:42:20 --> 01:42:27
 Do you think about that like this? As I told, we should not aspire for power. We should aspire only for

1023
01:42:30 --> 01:42:37
 responsibility. That you repeatedly think that will form a samskara in you. And that will always come to your risk

1024
01:42:37 --> 01:42:44
 at the proper time.

1025
01:42:46 --> 01:42:53
 Padanamaskaram, Swami. Swami, you told the personal work of God is 100% related to God only.

1026
01:42:57 --> 01:43:02
 What is the reason for that?

1027
01:43:02 --> 01:43:09
 As I told, the personal work of God is 100% related to God only. If you see the mission of God, it is 50%

1028
01:43:12 --> 01:43:19
 related to the welfare of the souls and 50% related to God. Because God is pleased by the mission.

1029
01:43:21 --> 01:43:28
 Geeta says that perfect devotee shall have 100% concentration on God only, which is called as single-pointed devotion.

1030
01:43:33 --> 01:43:40
 Some devotees say that they are unable to do personal service to Swami and they are not much interested in

1031
01:43:43 --> 01:43:50
 propagation of Swami's knowledge. So, does this show that their higher level of one-pointed devotion to Swami?

1032
01:43:53 --> 01:44:00
 Yes, perfectly that is correct. After all, the higher level of one-pointed devotion to Swami is not

1033
01:44:02 --> 01:44:09
 what is the ultimate spiritual effort of sathana to develop 100% concentration on God.

1034
01:44:13 --> 01:44:20
 That is everything. Why should you worry about the mission of God?

1035
01:44:22 --> 01:44:28
 Even without you, he can do it in fraction of second. If he wants.

1036
01:44:29 --> 01:44:36
 Unless you help, he can't do it. Is he so incapable?

1037
01:44:38 --> 01:44:46
 Is God Rama so incapable of crossing the sea, killing Ravana and getting back Sita?

1038
01:44:49 --> 01:44:57
 In fact, it is also correct because he needed to cross the sea. If he thinks, let Ravana die, let Sita come to my side.

1039
01:44:59 --> 01:45:06
 It will happen in fraction of second. No need of bridge, no need of war.

1040
01:45:08 --> 01:45:14
 Why should you think about the propagation of spiritual knowledge?

1041
01:45:15 --> 01:45:19
 If suppose God thinks, let all be liberated, all be liberated.

1042
01:45:19 --> 01:45:32
 Even if you do some propagation work of God, you will put your dirty finger somewhere and spoil the mission only.

1043
01:45:34 --> 01:45:40
 And spoil the propagation of spiritual knowledge because somewhere you will show your intelligence.

1044
01:45:41 --> 01:45:49
 And give a false concept. Interpret, misinterpret the concept.

1045
01:45:50 --> 01:45:59
 Because we are dog's tails. We are dog's tails. Our tail never is straight.

1046
01:46:00 --> 01:46:07
 So if some concept is told by God is to be preached to public, he will certainly curve it.

1047
01:46:07 --> 01:46:15
 So instead of spoiling, better keep silent. God will himself do it.

1048
01:46:17 --> 01:46:20
 So that is not the point at all. That is not the...

1049
01:46:21 --> 01:46:29
 The entire essence of the spiritual knowledge is to develop full concentration on God only.

1050
01:46:29 --> 01:46:34
 Leave everything behind. Leave everything aside.

1051
01:46:35 --> 01:46:38
 The only essence is God.

1052
01:46:39 --> 01:46:45
 If God wants, whether it is personal work or public work, that is immaterial to me.

1053
01:46:46 --> 01:46:52
 What he wants, that is the essence.

1054
01:46:52 --> 01:47:01
 That is the essence. That is the essence of the entire scriptures.

1055
01:47:02 --> 01:47:09
 Holy concentration. What he... You see, that is what in Krishna Bhagavatam there is one sloka.

1056
01:47:10 --> 01:47:16
 Apapunya vivekaya kuto yam grandhavistara. The gopikas were sages previously.

1057
01:47:16 --> 01:47:20
 They wrote the ethics, dharmashastras.

1058
01:47:21 --> 01:47:30
 They told, papapunya vivekaya, which is punyam and which is papam, for that, why we have written so many dharmashastras?

1059
01:47:31 --> 01:47:38
 What is punyam and what is papam can be told in one sentence. Why we have written unnecessarily so many books?

1060
01:47:39 --> 01:47:44
 What is that one sentence? Hare kopa karam papam punyantasya priya pradham.

1061
01:47:44 --> 01:47:49
 What is dharma? What is punyam? That which pleases God is punyam.

1062
01:47:50 --> 01:47:57
 That which is disliked by God is adharma or papa.

1063
01:47:58 --> 01:48:08
 One sentence. Why we have written so many books to explain what is papa, what is punyam, what is dharma, what is adharma?

1064
01:48:09 --> 01:48:19
 Simply one sentence we could have told. Hare kopa karam papam. If it is not liked by God, that is papam.

1065
01:48:20 --> 01:48:25
 Punyantasya priya pradham. If it is liked by God, that is punyam, that is dharma.

1066
01:48:25 --> 01:48:39
 In one sentence it is told, it can be told. Why we have written so many dharmashastras for papa, punyam, dharma and adharma?

1067
01:48:44 --> 01:48:52
 That is the highest concept. Before that highest concept, all other are only secondary concepts.

1068
01:48:52 --> 01:48:57
 Secondary concepts cannot cross the highest concept.

1069
01:49:00 --> 01:49:07
 What is that highest concept? Hanuman is the highest concept. Radha is the highest concept.

1070
01:49:08 --> 01:49:18
 What can cross Radha and Hanuman? And what they have did? Complete 100% concentration on God.

1071
01:49:18 --> 01:49:24
 That too can't be human incarnation.

1072
01:49:25 --> 01:49:35
 We say Bhagavatam is the highest. We say Ramayanam is the highest. But we don't accept the essence.

1073
01:49:35 --> 01:49:47
 We accept Ramayanam Bhagavatam, the highest. We accept Ramayanam Krishna also as Gods.

1074
01:49:48 --> 01:49:58
 But Ramayanam is human being, Krishna is human being. Can you accept human form as God? No, no, that time we can't.

1075
01:49:58 --> 01:50:04
 What they are teaching? Those epics are teaching.

1076
01:50:05 --> 01:50:16
 And by catching contemporary human incarnation, Hanuman has gone to Brahmaloka and Radha has gone to Goloka.

1077
01:50:17 --> 01:50:22
 Highest, highest fruits. There is no higher fruit than that.

1078
01:50:22 --> 01:50:28
 But why you are not accepting contemporary human incarnation?

1079
01:50:29 --> 01:50:34
 You accept the concept, but don't accept the example.

1080
01:50:35 --> 01:50:43
 That is the human weakness. That is the defect of human mind.

1081
01:50:43 --> 01:50:55
 Why he is losing? He is losing the actual point. Everything he is catching.

1082
01:50:56 --> 01:51:00
 When the actual point comes, he loses it.

1083
01:51:00 --> 01:51:17
 What is the use of catching all the other things and leaving the actual, not clue, essence?

1084
01:51:21 --> 01:51:24
 Any other question?

1085
01:51:25 --> 01:51:30
 Swami, there are some online questions Swami.

1086
01:51:31 --> 01:51:37
 This question is asked by Mr. Anil.

1087
01:51:38 --> 01:51:52
 10 rupees of hardened money also goes along with 10 paisa of corrupt money like compartments of train tied together. Why it is so?

1088
01:51:53 --> 01:51:55
 Again you repeat the question.

1089
01:51:56 --> 01:52:12
 Ok Swami. 10 rupees of hardened money also goes along with 10 paisa of corrupt money like compartments of train tied together. Why it is so?

1090
01:52:12 --> 01:52:25
 I am not catching the essence of the question.

1091
01:52:26 --> 01:52:30
 Why it is so means it is like Sathiridhi asking question.

1092
01:52:31 --> 01:52:41
 Swami, when you came as Vamana, you suppressed Bari Chakravarthi.

1093
01:52:42 --> 01:52:50
 Instead of that you could have asked when Vamana came to suppress Bari Chakravarthi, like that you can start.

1094
01:52:50 --> 01:53:00
 When you came as Vamana, so that Kerala government will send police to arrest me.

1095
01:53:01 --> 01:53:07
 Because for them Bari Chakravarthi is very important. Onam festival, you know, the worship of Bali.

1096
01:53:08 --> 01:53:13
 Why it is so means what can I do?

1097
01:53:13 --> 01:53:23
 That is a natural phenomenon. Why mango fruit comes to mango tree? It comes like that.

1098
01:53:24 --> 01:53:37
 So one thing I can say here that 10 rupees justified money and 10 paisa corrupt money.

1099
01:53:38 --> 01:53:56
 From this I can draw one concept that is even a person who is following justified path, most of his path is justified.

1100
01:53:56 --> 01:54:05
 But somewhere he does some 10 paisa corruption. Somewhere he slips.

1101
01:54:06 --> 01:54:12
 In some small place at least he slips and earns 10 paisa.

1102
01:54:13 --> 01:54:23
 Then only every 10 rupees, every justified, justified earned 10 rupees, 10 corrupt paisa will go.

1103
01:54:23 --> 01:54:32
 That means a person who earns 10 rupees in justified way is not present in the world.

1104
01:54:33 --> 01:54:38
 In this world, at least in this Kali Yuga.

1105
01:54:39 --> 01:54:45
 That is the conclusion I can draw from him, from his question.

1106
01:54:45 --> 01:55:02
 That shows the present situation of the world in Kali Yuga that every there is no 100 percent absolute justified person.

1107
01:55:03 --> 01:55:10
 Because in Kali Yuga three fourth is injustice. One fourth is only justice.

1108
01:55:10 --> 01:55:15
 Therefore injustice is ruling the Kali Yuga.

1109
01:55:16 --> 01:55:20
 So there is no 100 percent justified person.

1110
01:55:21 --> 01:55:29
 Even if you call somebody as 100 percent justified person, he might have earned 10 rupees through justice.

1111
01:55:30 --> 01:55:37
 But at least 10 paisa earned through injustice must be existing with him.

1112
01:55:37 --> 01:55:43
 So you ask why? Why means it is because of this Kali age.

1113
01:55:44 --> 01:55:50
 Why Kali age? Why you are blaming Kali time?

1114
01:55:51 --> 01:55:57
 Yes, in fact we should not blame time. We should blame ourselves.

1115
01:55:58 --> 01:56:17
 That means our ethical standards have fallen today to such extent that we don't find any 100 percent justified person in the present time.

1116
01:56:18 --> 01:56:25
 At least some little one paisa injustice must be with everybody.

1117
01:56:26 --> 01:56:36
 But by this you should not develop a concept that how can you advise me?

1118
01:56:37 --> 01:56:41
 You are also having one paisa injustice.

1119
01:56:42 --> 01:56:48
 You see you are having one paisa injustice but I am having 90 paisa injustice.

1120
01:56:49 --> 01:56:54
 That is why you can advise me. You should see the quantity also.

1121
01:56:55 --> 01:56:58
 Not quality only, quantity also.

1122
01:56:59 --> 01:57:01
 See you have come to this house.

1123
01:57:02 --> 01:57:09
 One mustard seed might have stuck to your pant and you might have gone to home.

1124
01:57:10 --> 01:57:13
 That is also theft of mustard seed.

1125
01:57:15 --> 01:57:23
 And one another fellow saw some pumpkin fruit and might have stolen it to the house.

1126
01:57:25 --> 01:57:27
 That is also qualitatively theft.

1127
01:57:28 --> 01:57:38
 Then the thief of mustard seed can advise that other fellow don't steal pumpkin fruit.

1128
01:57:39 --> 01:57:41
 It will become theft.

1129
01:57:42 --> 01:57:45
 You also stole mustard seed.

1130
01:57:48 --> 01:57:50
 What right you have to advise me?

1131
01:57:51 --> 01:57:52
 Not like that.

1132
01:57:52 --> 01:57:53
 Not like that.

1133
01:57:54 --> 01:57:56
 Quantitative difference must be also taken.

1134
01:57:57 --> 01:58:10
 After one paisa injustice by his lack of attention, by his negligence it might have been done.

1135
01:58:11 --> 01:58:18
 Thinking that it is also correct, he might have done that one paisa injustice.

1136
01:58:18 --> 01:58:35
 So, like that, that shows the general fall of standard of ethics and general fall of devotion to God.

1137
01:58:36 --> 01:58:41
 If devotion to God is there, sin will not be done.

1138
01:58:42 --> 01:58:46
 In fear relaxation may come.

1139
01:58:46 --> 01:58:52
 But if devotion is there to God, the sin will not happen.

1140
01:58:53 --> 01:59:06
 If unintentionally, unknowingly some trace of sin happens, it will not create much problem to him.

1141
01:59:07 --> 01:59:08
 It is unintentional.

1142
01:59:09 --> 01:59:13
 You are walking on the road, the ant has fallen under your feet.

1143
01:59:13 --> 01:59:14
 It died.

1144
01:59:15 --> 01:59:16
 There is no intention.

1145
01:59:17 --> 01:59:18
 It is not a sin.

1146
01:59:22 --> 01:59:29
 Therefore, you have to treat such people also as 100% justified people.

1147
01:59:30 --> 01:59:31
 Ok?

1148
01:59:32 --> 01:59:33
 Yes, Swami.

1149
01:59:33 --> 01:59:37
 Swami, next question is from Mr. Ansraj.

1150
01:59:39 --> 01:59:40
 Namaskaran, Swami.

1151
01:59:41 --> 01:59:49
 What are the various forms of theoretical and practical devotion that can be practised?

1152
01:59:49 --> 01:59:58
 What are the various forms of theoretical and practical devotion that can be practised?

1153
01:59:58 --> 02:00:17
 You see, there are of course eight types of devotion, all that you know, Ravana, Kirtana,

1154
02:00:17 --> 02:00:24
 Vishnu, Asmara, Parasayavana, Arjuna, Vandana, Dasya, Sakya, Ata, Nivedana.

1155
02:00:24 --> 02:00:31
 These nine types of devotion are told by the scripture.

1156
02:00:31 --> 02:00:47
 But to make it simplify, what I say is, the best thing is to hear the details of God.

1157
02:00:47 --> 02:00:59
 If that is done, you have thrown matchstick, and burning is definite.

1158
02:00:59 --> 02:01:03
 Everything will stick.

1159
02:01:03 --> 02:01:11
 You are not interested in God only because of lack of details of knowledge of God.

1160
02:01:11 --> 02:01:31
 So, here when you see the TV, you see the channels which preach the details of God,

1161
02:01:31 --> 02:01:42
 and also which preach the spiritual knowledge of God, that is the real essence of God.

1162
02:01:42 --> 02:01:54
 And if you see cinemas, see cinemas which are completely divine.

1163
02:01:54 --> 02:01:58
 Even partially divine are also good.

1164
02:01:58 --> 02:02:10
 Nowadays, they are taking cinemas, the trend is everything social, now and then God, introduction.

1165
02:02:10 --> 02:02:21
 Like that Hanuman picture, very one or two places only God Hanuman appears.

1166
02:02:21 --> 02:02:24
 Rest is social story only.

1167
02:02:24 --> 02:02:33
 There also the impression on God can happen very well.

1168
02:02:33 --> 02:02:44
 It is just like while eating the hot dishes, you eat the sweet dish.

1169
02:02:44 --> 02:02:47
 That will be very tasty, no?

1170
02:02:48 --> 02:02:58
 Then continuously eating the sweet dish, that you will get bored.

1171
02:02:58 --> 02:03:03
 So, such cinemas are getting good success also.

1172
02:03:03 --> 02:03:17
 Now, eat continuously hot dishes, now and then you eat the sweet dish, that will have lot of impression.

1173
02:03:17 --> 02:03:24
 Such trend cinemas are succeeding nowadays.

1174
02:03:24 --> 02:03:36
 Completely social this picture is just like eating continuous hot dishes, that also you will get bored.

1175
02:03:36 --> 02:03:42
 Completely eating sweet dishes also you will get bored.

1176
02:03:42 --> 02:03:51
 So, that is why God says in Dattavedam I have written,

1177
02:03:51 --> 02:04:10
 You are in the path of devotion, for some time you will be forcibly dragged to the world.

1178
02:04:10 --> 02:04:21
 And you will spend some time in the world and you get bored, vexed, pained.

1179
02:04:21 --> 02:04:28
 Then you will come to the God, it is just like the culvert.

1180
02:04:28 --> 02:04:37
 Culvert stopping the water, flow of water, only to increase the speed of the flow of water.

1181
02:04:37 --> 02:04:43
 When it crosses the culvert, it brings lot of speed.

1182
02:05:07 --> 02:05:11
 So, you need not, that is what,

1183
02:05:11 --> 02:05:16
 Narada Bhakti Sutra also the sutra says,

1184
02:05:16 --> 02:05:25
 Thadarpitha khilacharatha tadvismarane paramavyakulateti

1185
02:05:25 --> 02:05:37
 That is when you are dragged by Maya into the world, after some time you feel very much pained.

1186
02:05:37 --> 02:05:41
 Oh, I have lost God.

1187
02:05:41 --> 02:05:50
 You get lot of pain and reattach to God.

1188
02:05:50 --> 02:05:56
 So, that is the real devotion, that is what Sage Narada says.

1189
02:05:56 --> 02:06:00
 Thadvismarane paramavyakulateti

1190
02:06:00 --> 02:06:08
 When you are dragged into the world from God, you will be bored with the world for some time.

1191
02:06:08 --> 02:06:19
 And then when you return to God, it is just like water crossing the culvert with terrible speed.

1192
02:06:19 --> 02:06:23
 That is what Sage Narada told in Bhakti Sutra.

1193
02:06:23 --> 02:06:27
 Thadvismarane paramavyakulateti

1194
02:06:27 --> 02:06:34
 That is very much suitable for this Kali Yuga, for this present day.

1195
02:06:34 --> 02:06:41
 That is very much, don't worry when you are dragged into the world.

1196
02:06:42 --> 02:06:53
 And when you come back from the world to God, you will get very good attachment to God.

1197
02:06:53 --> 02:06:57
 Very good attachment.

1198
02:06:57 --> 02:07:09
 So that world, dragging to the world, dragged to the world serves like a hot dish while eating sweet dishes.

1199
02:07:10 --> 02:07:13
 It only increases the devotion.

1200
02:07:13 --> 02:07:19
 So you need not worry, we are dragged into this world unnecessarily.

1201
02:07:19 --> 02:07:25
 We have forgotten God, I have lost the time unnecessarily.

1202
02:07:25 --> 02:07:34
 See, you have lost the time no doubt, but in that time the speed of the water is slow.

1203
02:07:34 --> 02:07:42
 But even though you lost the time, when you get back, the speed is very much.

1204
02:07:42 --> 02:07:49
 That is Sage Narada's excellent point.

1205
02:07:53 --> 02:07:55
 Anything more?

1206
02:07:56 --> 02:07:59
 Namaskaram Swami.

1207
02:07:59 --> 02:08:03
 Swami, you just explained about single pointed devotion.

1208
02:08:03 --> 02:08:08
 Whatever God wants or wishes, concentrate 100% on that.

1209
02:08:08 --> 02:08:12
 My question is, what actually you want Swami, that will please you the most?

1210
02:08:12 --> 02:08:18
 Is it your personal service or propagation of your spiritual knowledge or context based?

1211
02:08:18 --> 02:08:21
 You ask God.

1212
02:08:22 --> 02:08:24
 That's what it is.

1213
02:08:24 --> 02:08:26
 What is your message?

1214
02:08:26 --> 02:08:33
 Would you like to take coffee or tea or some cool drink?

1215
02:08:33 --> 02:08:37
 That is what people ask.

1216
02:08:37 --> 02:08:42
 What you like, I must know.

1217
02:08:42 --> 02:08:47
 And I must bring that to you without asking you.

1218
02:08:47 --> 02:08:58
 Without asking you, I bring coffee to you, deciding that you like coffee.

1219
02:08:58 --> 02:09:10
 Then the mistake is that your intention is that coffee is liked by God, that is your intention.

1220
02:09:10 --> 02:09:16
 But God should like the coffee, that is the concept.

1221
02:09:16 --> 02:09:28
 Whether God likes coffee or tea or green tea or something, suppose you ask God, will it not be clear?

1222
02:09:28 --> 02:09:31
 Is it not clear?

1223
02:09:33 --> 02:09:36
 What do you like?

1224
02:09:37 --> 02:09:46
 One time he may like tea, another time he may like coffee, another time he may like some juice.

1225
02:09:46 --> 02:09:48
 Is it not?

1226
02:09:48 --> 02:09:52
 Context to context, that also differs.

1227
02:09:52 --> 02:09:56
 God will always like coffee, that is not.

1228
02:09:56 --> 02:09:58
 He also wants entertainment.

1229
02:09:58 --> 02:10:00
 He wants change.

1230
02:10:00 --> 02:10:08
 He got bored with the continuous loneliness.

1231
02:10:08 --> 02:10:15
 He wanted entertainment with the second item.

1232
02:10:15 --> 02:10:17
 Is it not?

1233
02:10:17 --> 02:10:19
 God also gets bored.

1234
02:10:22 --> 02:10:29
 So that is not, especially in the case of contemporary human incarnation, that problem will not come.

1235
02:10:30 --> 02:10:32
 That problem will not come.

1236
02:10:32 --> 02:10:38
 God expresses his desire completely, even before you ask.

1237
02:10:44 --> 02:10:46
 I tell you an example.

1238
02:10:46 --> 02:10:50
 Rama entered into the war.

1239
02:10:51 --> 02:10:57
 After the end of the first day war, Rama told Ravana,

1240
02:10:57 --> 02:11:04
 you bring back Sita and give to me, I will stop the war and go back to Ayodhya.

1241
02:11:04 --> 02:11:08
 Then what Hanuman should have thought?

1242
02:11:08 --> 02:11:13
 Hanuman is also incarnation of God Shiva.

1243
02:11:13 --> 02:11:21
 God Shiva took the avatar of Hanuman, incarnation, to help Rama to kill Ravana.

1244
02:11:21 --> 02:11:27
 The main purpose of Ramayana is to kill Ravana.

1245
02:11:27 --> 02:11:29
 Who is he troubling all?

1246
02:11:29 --> 02:11:31
 Is it not?

1247
02:11:31 --> 02:11:35
 Then Hanuman should have thought like this.

1248
02:11:35 --> 02:11:40
 This fellow Vishnu is very selfish.

1249
02:11:40 --> 02:11:47
 He says that if Sita is brought, he will stop the war and go back to Ayodhya.

1250
02:11:47 --> 02:11:52
 For what purpose God Vishnu took the avatar of Rama?

1251
02:11:52 --> 02:11:57
 For what purpose I took the avatar of Hanuman?

1252
02:11:57 --> 02:12:00
 This fellow forgot everything.

1253
02:12:00 --> 02:12:04
 Why Rama went to forest?

1254
02:12:04 --> 02:12:07
 So that Ravana will steal Sita.

1255
02:12:07 --> 02:12:10
 So that Ravana will go and kill Ravana.

1256
02:12:10 --> 02:12:12
 That is the thing.

1257
02:12:12 --> 02:12:17
 He forgot everything.

1258
02:12:17 --> 02:12:22
 Because Rama is Manushavatar, Adarshya Manushavatar.

1259
02:12:22 --> 02:12:25
 He is not Leela Manushavatar like Krishna.

1260
02:12:25 --> 02:12:27
 He doesn't remember.

1261
02:12:27 --> 02:12:31
 He is immersed in the role.

1262
02:12:31 --> 02:12:36
 He doesn't remember that he is the actor.

1263
02:12:36 --> 02:12:39
 But he is testing Hanuman.

1264
02:12:39 --> 02:12:42
 That is what I am telling you.

1265
02:12:42 --> 02:12:45
 So Hanuman should have thought like this.

1266
02:12:45 --> 02:12:47
 And come to Rama and told,

1267
02:12:47 --> 02:12:49
 Rama, you take Sita.

1268
02:12:49 --> 02:12:52
 Suppose he brings Sita.

1269
02:12:52 --> 02:12:55
 You take Sita and go back to Ayodhya.

1270
02:12:55 --> 02:12:58
 Tomorrow I will fight with Ravana.

1271
02:12:58 --> 02:13:01
 I will kill Ravana.

1272
02:13:01 --> 02:13:06
 Though you are not serving the program mission,

1273
02:13:06 --> 02:13:08
 I will complete the mission.

1274
02:13:08 --> 02:13:13
 I will kill Ravana.

1275
02:13:13 --> 02:13:15
 He did not say like that.

1276
02:13:15 --> 02:13:17
 You know, in fact, next day,

1277
02:13:17 --> 02:13:22
 had Ravana brought Sita and given to Rama,

1278
02:13:22 --> 02:13:25
 and Rama returned back to Ayodhya,

1279
02:13:25 --> 02:13:28
 Hanuman will follow Rama to Ayodhya.

1280
02:13:28 --> 02:13:31
 He will not do the work.

1281
02:13:31 --> 02:13:34
 He will not fight with Ravana.

1282
02:13:36 --> 02:13:39
 Rama already expressed.

1283
02:13:39 --> 02:13:42
 You are telling that how to know.

1284
02:13:42 --> 02:13:44
 Even before you are asking that,

1285
02:13:44 --> 02:13:47
 do you like coffee, do you like tea?

1286
02:13:47 --> 02:13:52
 Rama came and told, I like coffee.

1287
02:13:52 --> 02:13:54
 I like brew coffee.

1288
02:13:54 --> 02:13:57
 He announced already.

1289
02:13:57 --> 02:14:01
 To that distance we need not go.

1290
02:14:07 --> 02:14:08
 Okay.

1291
02:14:08 --> 02:14:09
 Thank you, Swami.

1292
02:14:09 --> 02:14:11
 Then next.

1293
02:14:11 --> 02:14:17
 Swami, next question is from Mr. Vishnu.

1294
02:14:17 --> 02:14:21
 Swami, as you said,

1295
02:14:21 --> 02:14:24
 listening about divine honey,

1296
02:14:24 --> 02:14:28
 at least while drinking coffee is the first step.

1297
02:14:28 --> 02:14:30
 In the same way,

1298
02:14:30 --> 02:14:32
 Honey is not divine nectar.

1299
02:14:32 --> 02:14:35
 Yes, Swami. Divine nectar,

1300
02:14:35 --> 02:14:38
 at least while drinking coffee is the first step.

1301
02:14:38 --> 02:14:39
 In the same way,

1302
02:14:39 --> 02:14:42
 if listening to this satsang is the first step,

1303
02:14:42 --> 02:14:47
 how can people follow all the remaining steps

1304
02:14:47 --> 02:14:53
 and see God who doesn't even understand this satsang in English,

1305
02:14:53 --> 02:14:56
 which is the first step?

1306
02:15:18 --> 02:15:20
 I told in Telugu.

1307
02:15:20 --> 02:15:21
 You are telling in English,

1308
02:15:21 --> 02:15:22
 we understand in Telugu,

1309
02:15:22 --> 02:15:24
 but English is not understood.

1310
02:15:24 --> 02:15:27
 That's why you are attending the satsang.

1311
02:15:27 --> 02:15:28
 I don't understand anything now.

1312
02:15:28 --> 02:15:31
 What can I do if I attend now?

1313
02:15:31 --> 02:15:35
 That means,

1314
02:15:35 --> 02:15:40
 for so many years I did satsangas in Telugu.

1315
02:15:40 --> 02:15:44
 While I was in Andhra Pradesh,

1316
02:15:44 --> 02:15:46
 I wrote several books.

1317
02:15:46 --> 02:15:50
 Several books were published in Telugu only.

1318
02:15:50 --> 02:15:54
 Almost all the books were published in Telugu.

1319
02:15:58 --> 02:16:02
 Now I thought that

1320
02:16:02 --> 02:16:07
 the international language or

1321
02:16:07 --> 02:16:11
 world language is English.

1322
02:16:11 --> 02:16:15
 For some time I served

1323
02:16:15 --> 02:16:17
 Telugu, my mother tongue,

1324
02:16:17 --> 02:16:20
 and my native state.

1325
02:16:20 --> 02:16:22
 I served.

1326
02:16:23 --> 02:16:28
 But I should serve other states also.

1327
02:16:30 --> 02:16:34
 The rest part of the world I must serve.

1328
02:16:34 --> 02:16:40
 And if I conduct in English,

1329
02:16:40 --> 02:16:42
 then even in Telugu state,

1330
02:16:42 --> 02:16:45
 there are several who understand English.

1331
02:16:48 --> 02:16:50
 In English people,

1332
02:16:50 --> 02:16:52
 in English there may be people

1333
02:16:52 --> 02:16:55
 who may not understand Telugu.

1334
02:16:55 --> 02:16:57
 But in Telugu state,

1335
02:16:57 --> 02:17:00
 there are people who can understand English.

1336
02:17:06 --> 02:17:11
 That is the program.

1337
02:17:12 --> 02:17:15
 I worked in Andhra Pradesh.

1338
02:17:15 --> 02:17:19
 And God Datta transferred me to English.

1339
02:17:19 --> 02:17:22
 He gives a transfer to some other state.

1340
02:17:22 --> 02:17:25
 Should the employee go or not?

1341
02:17:25 --> 02:17:27
 No, I will be in Andhra only.

1342
02:17:27 --> 02:17:29
 I will not.

1343
02:17:30 --> 02:17:36
 I did a lot of service in Telugu.

1344
02:17:36 --> 02:17:39
 And whatever I am teaching in English,

1345
02:17:39 --> 02:17:42
 is already told in Telugu.

1346
02:17:42 --> 02:17:47
 It is already recorded and printed in Telugu.

1347
02:17:47 --> 02:17:50
 Of course, I may give different examples

1348
02:17:50 --> 02:17:51
 at different times.

1349
02:17:51 --> 02:17:53
 But concepts are same.

1350
02:17:53 --> 02:17:57
 Concepts, there is no loss.

1351
02:18:00 --> 02:18:02
 In Telugu versions also,

1352
02:18:02 --> 02:18:04
 I am sending everyday in the form of messages.

1353
02:18:04 --> 02:18:06
 All the messages, I am sending

1354
02:18:06 --> 02:18:08
 whatever is written in Telugu.

1355
02:18:08 --> 02:18:10
 That is also not correct.

1356
02:18:10 --> 02:18:12
 If you are sending in Telugu,

1357
02:18:12 --> 02:18:14
 why not in Tamil?

1358
02:18:14 --> 02:18:16
 Why not in Hindi?

1359
02:18:16 --> 02:18:18
 Why not in Punjabi?

1360
02:18:18 --> 02:18:20
 Malayali?

1361
02:18:20 --> 02:18:22
 You see.

1362
02:18:25 --> 02:18:31
 English, if you want to know in Telugu,

1363
02:18:33 --> 02:18:35
 you get it translated

1364
02:18:36 --> 02:18:39
 by an English and Telugu scholar.

1365
02:18:41 --> 02:18:43
 For example, let us take

1366
02:18:43 --> 02:18:49
 Rama Sundari is not entertaining much English.

1367
02:18:49 --> 02:18:51
 She always fights with me.

1368
02:18:51 --> 02:18:57
 Swami, you are not doing justice to Telugu.

1369
02:18:57 --> 02:19:01
 Like that, she fights with me.

1370
02:19:01 --> 02:19:03
 But power is there.

1371
02:19:03 --> 02:19:05
 She can ask her own son.

1372
02:19:05 --> 02:19:07
 She can ask him.

1373
02:19:09 --> 02:19:12
 And he can translate and tell to her.

1374
02:19:12 --> 02:19:16
 Instead of trying to change the source,

1375
02:19:19 --> 02:19:21
 instead of saying that

1376
02:19:21 --> 02:19:26
 from that station I must get railway train only,

1377
02:19:26 --> 02:19:28
 I will not trial in bus.

1378
02:19:29 --> 02:19:33
 You have to get down at a station by train

1379
02:19:33 --> 02:19:35
 and then take a bus.

1380
02:19:35 --> 02:19:37
 No, no, I will not go by bus.

1381
02:19:37 --> 02:19:41
 From there also there must be railway line.

1382
02:19:41 --> 02:19:43
 That you will not do.

1383
02:19:46 --> 02:19:49
 General main lines or train lines are there.

1384
02:19:49 --> 02:19:52
 But to some places trains are not there.

1385
02:19:52 --> 02:19:54
 Buses are there.

1386
02:19:54 --> 02:19:56
 You have to use bus.

1387
02:19:58 --> 02:20:03
 No, no, let that train come to my place also.

1388
02:20:03 --> 02:20:06
 Like that you should cooperate.

1389
02:20:06 --> 02:20:09
 You should cooperate with the program.

1390
02:20:16 --> 02:20:20
 Because how can you treat me as a Telugu man?

1391
02:20:24 --> 02:20:26
 That is not Telugu man.

1392
02:20:26 --> 02:20:28
 He is universal.

1393
02:20:28 --> 02:20:30
 Universal. He is Vishwaguru.

1394
02:20:32 --> 02:20:34
 He is the guru of the entire world.

1395
02:20:34 --> 02:20:40
 And especially he is based on universal spirituality.

1396
02:20:40 --> 02:20:58
 I don't feel anything.

1397
02:20:58 --> 02:21:02
 Especially in Andhra people,

1398
02:21:02 --> 02:21:04
 Telugu people,

1399
02:21:04 --> 02:21:06
 they are not very active.

1400
02:21:06 --> 02:21:12
 They are always filled with doubts.

1401
02:21:12 --> 02:21:16
 Any amount of spiritual knowledge you may inject into them.

1402
02:21:16 --> 02:21:18
 But the doubts will be coming.

1403
02:21:18 --> 02:21:21
 That is why in Veda it is told,

1404
02:21:21 --> 02:21:24
 Andha Havata Ichchandra.

1405
02:21:24 --> 02:21:30
 Vishwamitra says Vishwamitra is the only one who is active.

1406
02:21:30 --> 02:21:33
 Andha Havata Ichchandra.

1407
02:21:33 --> 02:21:38
 Vishwamitra says Vishwamitra had 100 sons.

1408
02:21:38 --> 02:21:46
 And his sister is Satchavati.

1409
02:21:46 --> 02:21:54
 And his son is purchased by King Harishchandra

1410
02:21:54 --> 02:21:59
 to be given in sacrifice in his sacra egyam.

1411
02:21:59 --> 02:22:06
 That son is taken by, he is called as Shonash Sheva.

1412
02:22:06 --> 02:22:12
 He is taken by King Harishchandra.

1413
02:22:12 --> 02:22:24
 On the way, he came to the ashram of Sage Vishwamitra.

1414
02:22:24 --> 02:22:28
 Sage Vishwamitra had 100 sons.

1415
02:22:28 --> 02:22:32
 Shonash Sheva is his maternal uncle.

1416
02:22:32 --> 02:22:37
 Sage Vishwamitra is the maternal uncle of Shonash Sheva.

1417
02:22:37 --> 02:22:44
 Then Shonash Sheva, Sage Vishwamitra called his 100 sons one by one.

1418
02:22:44 --> 02:22:53
 My maternal, he is going to be sacrificed.

1419
02:22:54 --> 02:23:01
 At least one of you go instead of him for the sacraments.

1420
02:23:01 --> 02:23:08
 Then everybody refused, telling you go instead of telling Andhra.

1421
02:23:08 --> 02:23:10
 You go.

1422
02:23:10 --> 02:23:14
 Then Sage Vishwamitra cursed them.

1423
02:23:14 --> 02:23:17
 Andha Havata Ichchandra.

1424
02:23:17 --> 02:23:20
 You become blind.

1425
02:23:20 --> 02:23:25
 They became Andhras.

1426
02:23:25 --> 02:23:28
 They became Andhras.

1427
02:23:28 --> 02:23:34
 See, one quality of Andhra is that, Andhra means blind.

1428
02:23:34 --> 02:23:36
 Andha, blind.

1429
02:23:36 --> 02:23:42
 When he goes to see a drama, he doesn't see the scenes and claps.

1430
02:23:42 --> 02:23:48
 If others clap, he claps.

1431
02:23:48 --> 02:23:50
 He claps at the end.

1432
02:23:50 --> 02:23:54
 No, whatever I feel I am telling frankly.

1433
02:23:54 --> 02:23:57
 Though I am Andhra, I am telling.

1434
02:23:57 --> 02:24:01
 I am not an other state person criticizing Andhras.

1435
02:24:01 --> 02:24:06
 I myself am Andhra.

1436
02:24:06 --> 02:24:12
 So, somehow they hear the knowledge.

1437
02:24:12 --> 02:24:15
 They understand very well.

1438
02:24:15 --> 02:24:20
 Very, very good understanding power is there.

1439
02:24:20 --> 02:24:29
 But in small, basic, small, they don't mind the loss of pumpkin fruits.

1440
02:24:29 --> 02:24:33
 They are very careful about mustard seeds.

1441
02:24:33 --> 02:24:40
 The loss of mustard seeds, you know, when I went their houses

1442
02:24:40 --> 02:24:48
 and preach spiritual knowledge for hours together for their welfare,

1443
02:24:48 --> 02:24:55
 they were calculating for giving meals to me.

1444
02:24:55 --> 02:25:01
 I know they did not express, but I know their minds.

1445
02:25:01 --> 02:25:03
 They were calculating about the meals.

1446
02:25:03 --> 02:25:11
 After all, one meal to a person, how much it costs?

1447
02:25:11 --> 02:25:12
 Is it not?

1448
02:25:12 --> 02:25:15
 After our eating, so much is wasted also.

1449
02:25:15 --> 02:25:20
 Sometimes it is wasted.

1450
02:25:20 --> 02:25:23
 They hear the knowledge for the whole day.

1451
02:25:23 --> 02:25:31
 But in the night if I stay for meals, they are calculating.

1452
02:25:31 --> 02:25:35
 See, I am giving divine nectar.

1453
02:25:35 --> 02:25:41
 I am giving divine nectar which will create devotion in them.

1454
02:25:41 --> 02:25:48
 And by that devotion, they can get mountains of wealth.

1455
02:25:48 --> 02:25:53
 Mountains of wealth.

1456
02:25:53 --> 02:25:56
 But they are not seeing that.

1457
02:25:56 --> 02:26:02
 They are calculating the cost of the meals that is given to me.

1458
02:26:02 --> 02:26:06
 See, instead of preaching this knowledge to them,

1459
02:26:06 --> 02:26:17
 if I preach in IIT entrance, I was an IIT entrance teacher in Narayana, Chaitanya and all that.

1460
02:26:17 --> 02:26:19
 They give Nalanda.

1461
02:26:19 --> 02:26:23
 They give lakhs of rupees.

1462
02:26:23 --> 02:26:27
 When I resigned from a job from KLCE,

1463
02:26:27 --> 02:26:37
 Narayana has sent one of his college principals to my house offering 60 lakhs per month.

1464
02:26:37 --> 02:26:44
 I was recognized as specialist in energetics.

1465
02:26:44 --> 02:26:50
 Energetics, there is a chapter in intermediate in IIT also.

1466
02:26:50 --> 02:26:58
 He came to my house offering 60 lakhs per year.

1467
02:26:58 --> 02:27:01
 I left it. I refused. You know that.

1468
02:27:01 --> 02:27:07
 I refused that and dedicated myself to preach spiritual knowledge.

1469
02:27:07 --> 02:27:11
 That will not only give salvation to you,

1470
02:27:11 --> 02:27:19
 but that also will develop devotion in you by which God is pleased to give you mountains of wealth.

1471
02:27:19 --> 02:27:28
 Mountains of wealth will come by the devotion of God.

1472
02:27:28 --> 02:27:33
 So that is how I got really to speak.

1473
02:27:33 --> 02:27:36
 I got some aversion to Andhras.

1474
02:27:36 --> 02:27:39
 These are blind people.

1475
02:27:39 --> 02:27:42
 They cannot be uplifted.

1476
02:27:42 --> 02:27:45
 Of course, there are some exceptions.

1477
02:27:45 --> 02:27:47
 There are very good exceptions.

1478
02:27:47 --> 02:27:48
 Pani is an exception.

1479
02:27:48 --> 02:27:50
 Ajaygarh is an exception.

1480
02:27:50 --> 02:27:52
 Sharma is an exception.

1481
02:27:52 --> 02:27:58
 So there are, see, everywhere there are good people and bad people.

1482
02:27:58 --> 02:28:01
 I don't say 100%.

1483
02:28:01 --> 02:28:05
 Some good people are there. Some good people.

1484
02:28:05 --> 02:28:09
 They are by mistake born in Andhra.

1485
02:28:17 --> 02:28:24
 So I have published so many books in Telugu only.

1486
02:28:24 --> 02:28:28
 Sanskrit and Telugu translations.

1487
02:28:28 --> 02:28:32
 We did not publish any book in English.

1488
02:28:32 --> 02:28:34
 Only 10 books.

1489
02:28:34 --> 02:28:38
 Only 2 lakh books were published.

1490
02:28:38 --> 02:28:42
 100 varieties and 2 lakh books.

1491
02:28:42 --> 02:28:48
 All books I have published in Telugu only.

1492
02:28:48 --> 02:28:52
 Only later on this website is in English.

1493
02:28:52 --> 02:28:55
 And my speeches are in English.

1494
02:28:55 --> 02:28:59
 So not like that. Don't take that as serious thing.

1495
02:28:59 --> 02:29:04
 The main thing is I must not stick to a language.

1496
02:29:04 --> 02:29:10
 I must spread my knowledge throughout the world as far as possible.

1497
02:29:10 --> 02:29:15
 Because diamonds are scattered everywhere in the world.

1498
02:29:15 --> 02:29:20
 Gravel stones are segregated in every local region.

1499
02:29:20 --> 02:29:23
 Every place you have got gravel stones.

1500
02:29:23 --> 02:29:30
 But diamonds, one diamond here, one diamond in another state, another diamond in another country.

1501
02:29:30 --> 02:29:32
 Diamonds are scattered.

1502
02:29:32 --> 02:29:36
 Gravel stones are segregated.

1503
02:29:37 --> 02:29:41
 So my knowledge is always for diamonds.

1504
02:29:41 --> 02:29:44
 Not for gravel stones.

1505
02:29:44 --> 02:29:48
 What is the use of teaching gravel stones?

1506
02:29:48 --> 02:29:51
 Nothing will enter into their brain.

1507
02:29:51 --> 02:29:58
 Finally after hearing the whole knowledge, what enters that brain, that gravel stone?

1508
02:29:58 --> 02:30:03
 brain is if we give meals to him today, what is its cost?

1509
02:30:03 --> 02:30:13
 Only that will be, that will enter into the brain.

1510
02:30:13 --> 02:30:19
 So anyway, they are also my children only.

1511
02:30:19 --> 02:30:24
 I must give more attention for them.

1512
02:30:24 --> 02:30:35
 That is why I have published so many books in Telugu.

1513
02:30:35 --> 02:30:38
 So okay.

1514
02:30:38 --> 02:30:41
 Yes Swami.

1515
02:30:41 --> 02:30:44
 Swami, next question Swami.

1516
02:30:44 --> 02:30:48
 This question is from Miss Bhargavi.

1517
02:30:48 --> 02:30:50
 Namaskaram Swami.

1518
02:30:50 --> 02:30:59
 Whenever I say something related to human incarnations, my friends usually don't trust.

1519
02:30:59 --> 02:31:08
 Some even ask why you even believe these incarnations when we already have so many gods.

1520
02:31:08 --> 02:31:14
 I am not good at explaining the importance of human incarnations.

1521
02:31:14 --> 02:31:21
 I am afraid they might make fun of human incarnations which is a sin.

1522
02:31:21 --> 02:31:27
 I know you understand my situation as you are Sarvajna.

1523
02:31:27 --> 02:31:29
 What should I do Swami?

1524
02:31:29 --> 02:31:33
 See you simply put one question to them.

1525
02:31:33 --> 02:31:41
 Who is the greatest devotee of God in this creation so far?

1526
02:31:41 --> 02:31:44
 Hanuman and Radha.

1527
02:31:44 --> 02:31:50
 Hanuman has gone to Brahma Loka, Satchaloka.

1528
02:31:50 --> 02:31:53
 Radha has gone to Goloka.

1529
02:31:53 --> 02:32:02
 Is there a greater devotee than Hanuman and Radha you ask?

1530
02:32:02 --> 02:32:07
 See you at least examine the fruits they got.

1531
02:32:07 --> 02:32:12
 Brahma Loka is the ultimate loka of world of God.

1532
02:32:12 --> 02:32:15
 That is ultimate abode of God.

1533
02:32:15 --> 02:32:21
 Goloka is higher than Brahma Loka, higher than the abode of God.

1534
02:32:21 --> 02:32:26
 Who reached these two highest fruits?

1535
02:32:26 --> 02:32:31
 Hanuman and Radha.

1536
02:32:31 --> 02:32:38
 Hanuman and Radha both worshipped contemporary human incarnations.

1537
02:32:38 --> 02:32:41
 Not even past human incarnations.

1538
02:32:41 --> 02:32:46
 We worshipped Rama and Krishna, past human incarnations.

1539
02:32:46 --> 02:32:49
 But we don't worship contemporary human incarnations.

1540
02:32:49 --> 02:32:51
 Hanuman and Radha are not like that.

1541
02:32:51 --> 02:32:56
 Hanuman did not worship Vamana and Narasimha, past human incarnations.

1542
02:32:56 --> 02:33:00
 Hanuman worshipped Rama, his contemporary human incarnations.

1543
02:33:00 --> 02:33:04
 Krishna, Gokas did not worship Rama.

1544
02:33:04 --> 02:33:07
 They worshipped Krishna, the contemporary human incarnations.

1545
02:33:07 --> 02:33:12
 And both Hanuman and Gokas got the highest fruit.

1546
02:33:15 --> 02:33:23
 What more logic is needed if he doesn't understand this much?

1547
02:33:23 --> 02:33:28
 He doesn't have brain in his head.

1548
02:33:30 --> 02:33:33
 No brain in his head.

1549
02:33:33 --> 02:33:38
 And such fellow, you cannot do anything.

1550
02:33:38 --> 02:33:40
 See there is a shloka.

1551
02:33:47 --> 02:33:52
 In a village, everywhere municipal water taps are there.

1552
02:33:52 --> 02:33:55
 Very good water is coming.

1553
02:33:55 --> 02:34:02
 One fellow in his house, one well is there.

1554
02:34:02 --> 02:34:05
 That well is full of salt water.

1555
02:34:05 --> 02:34:08
 But that fellow drinks only that water,

1556
02:34:08 --> 02:34:11
 telling, my father dug this well.

1557
02:34:16 --> 02:34:18
 Since my father dug this well,

1558
02:34:18 --> 02:34:20
 I will drink water only from that,

1559
02:34:20 --> 02:34:24
 even if it is saltiest and hardest water.

1560
02:34:25 --> 02:34:28
 I will not drink soft water.

1561
02:34:32 --> 02:34:35
 What can you do with that fellow?

1562
02:34:38 --> 02:34:40
 Just leave him.

1563
02:34:40 --> 02:34:44
 For that person, this much logic is sufficient.

1564
02:34:44 --> 02:34:47
 Do you agree Rama and Krishna are Gods?

1565
02:34:47 --> 02:34:49
 Definitely.

1566
02:34:49 --> 02:34:54
 Do you agree that Ramayanam and Bhagavatam are the highest epics?

1567
02:34:54 --> 02:34:56
 Yes, they are highest epics.

1568
02:34:56 --> 02:35:00
 Do you agree that Hanuman and Radha are the highest epics?

1569
02:35:00 --> 02:35:02
 Do you agree that Hanuman and Radha

1570
02:35:02 --> 02:35:05
 worshipped only contemporary human incarnations?

1571
02:35:05 --> 02:35:08
 They never worshipped energetic incarnations.

1572
02:35:08 --> 02:35:11
 Nor they worshipped past human incarnations.

1573
02:35:11 --> 02:35:15
 They worshipped only contemporary human incarnations.

1574
02:35:15 --> 02:35:18
 And they got highest fruits.

1575
02:35:18 --> 02:35:22
 Nobody got any fruit equal to them.

1576
02:35:23 --> 02:35:26
 Sufficient, there is no need of further.

1577
02:35:26 --> 02:35:30
 These four or five sentences are sufficient.

1578
02:35:30 --> 02:35:34
 If he has got some gujju,

1579
02:35:36 --> 02:35:38
 grain in his head,

1580
02:35:38 --> 02:35:40
 he will follow.

1581
02:35:46 --> 02:35:48
 Swami, doubt.

1582
02:35:48 --> 02:35:49
 Yes.

1583
02:35:49 --> 02:35:53
 As a part of propagation of the divine knowledge,

1584
02:35:53 --> 02:35:56
 we are meeting with many people like this

1585
02:35:56 --> 02:36:01
 and we are also posting your discourses, cut, paste,

1586
02:36:01 --> 02:36:02
 in that manner.

1587
02:36:02 --> 02:36:05
 Sometimes we are discussing like that the process is going on.

1588
02:36:05 --> 02:36:09
 But in spite of listening and reading all those things,

1589
02:36:09 --> 02:36:11
 the people are very rigid,

1590
02:36:11 --> 02:36:15
 that ignoring, not accepting, not rejecting,

1591
02:36:15 --> 02:36:19
 just ignoring and want to continue chatting with me.

1592
02:36:19 --> 02:36:22
 That is how can I deal with them?

1593
02:36:22 --> 02:36:24
 Shall I continue propagation?

1594
02:36:24 --> 02:36:27
 See, you continue your propagation,

1595
02:36:27 --> 02:36:31
 it will take time to get the result.

1596
02:36:31 --> 02:36:37
 The initial stage itself, excellent results will not come.

1597
02:36:37 --> 02:36:45
 One lady was advised to do pradashnams to people three

1598
02:36:45 --> 02:36:48
 to get issues.

1599
02:36:49 --> 02:36:53
 One round she does and she is so happy.

1600
02:36:57 --> 02:37:01
 Rather pregnant she has to do pradashnams.

1601
02:37:01 --> 02:37:03
 It will take time.

1602
02:37:09 --> 02:37:11
 Some time it will take.

1603
02:37:11 --> 02:37:13
 Definitely one day,

1604
02:37:13 --> 02:37:15
 definitely one day,

1605
02:37:15 --> 02:37:18
 Narshtar Damas told,

1606
02:37:18 --> 02:37:23
 one day all religions will disappear.

1607
02:37:23 --> 02:37:28
 Only one religion will remain in this entire world.

1608
02:37:28 --> 02:37:35
 One fellow will come from a country surrounded by three seas.

1609
02:37:35 --> 02:37:38
 He is not only a Sanskrit scholar,

1610
02:37:38 --> 02:37:40
 but also a scientist.

1611
02:37:40 --> 02:37:43
 These are written by Narshtar Damas.

1612
02:37:43 --> 02:37:46
 All religions will disappear

1613
02:37:46 --> 02:37:51
 and only the Vedic religion established by him will remain.

1614
02:37:51 --> 02:37:54
 And in the entire universe,

1615
02:37:54 --> 02:37:56
 Thursday will become holiday.

1616
02:37:56 --> 02:37:59
 That is, Gaurdharta's day.

1617
02:37:59 --> 02:38:03
 So it is going to happen.

1618
02:38:03 --> 02:38:07
 One day, myself and Pani went to,

1619
02:38:07 --> 02:38:10
 we were talking with Koneer Sachinarayanan,

1620
02:38:10 --> 02:38:13
 chairman of KL University.

1621
02:38:15 --> 02:38:17
 He was telling,

1622
02:38:20 --> 02:38:23
 backside there was a big Hanuman's photo

1623
02:38:23 --> 02:38:25
 and he was telling,

1624
02:38:25 --> 02:38:29
 human incarnation is so much valid like that.

1625
02:38:29 --> 02:38:31
 Then I told,

1626
02:38:31 --> 02:38:34
 sir, I worked there,

1627
02:38:34 --> 02:38:37
 sir, backside of you,

1628
02:38:37 --> 02:38:39
 big photo of Hanuman is there,

1629
02:38:39 --> 02:38:42
 whom he worshipped.

1630
02:38:45 --> 02:38:47
 He was stunned.

1631
02:38:49 --> 02:38:51
 Then he told,

1632
02:38:51 --> 02:38:53
 Swami, one day,

1633
02:38:53 --> 02:39:00
 your knowledge will drown the entire world like tsunami.

1634
02:39:01 --> 02:39:03
 He was also there.

1635
02:39:04 --> 02:39:06
 So,

1636
02:39:08 --> 02:39:11
 one day the result will come.

1637
02:39:12 --> 02:39:15
 Let the pradakshams be completed.

1638
02:39:17 --> 02:39:20
 Let her become pregnant.

1639
02:39:20 --> 02:39:22
 Yes.

1640
02:39:22 --> 02:39:24
 Next.

1641
02:39:26 --> 02:39:31
 Swami, next question is from Ms. Snehita.

1642
02:39:31 --> 02:39:36
 Swami, if all human forms of God,

1643
02:39:36 --> 02:39:41
 like Dutta, Satya Sai Baba, Jesus, Allah, etc.

1644
02:39:41 --> 02:39:45
 and all of them commonly preach,

1645
02:39:45 --> 02:39:47
 God is one,

1646
02:39:47 --> 02:39:50
 then why do we have so many religions?

1647
02:39:52 --> 02:39:54
 You see,

1648
02:39:54 --> 02:39:57
 the internal God is only one.

1649
02:39:57 --> 02:40:00
 But the external dresses are different.

1650
02:40:02 --> 02:40:05
 Suppose in a cloth shop,

1651
02:40:05 --> 02:40:08
 are they not keeping different dresses?

1652
02:40:11 --> 02:40:17
 Only one person is going to wear all the dresses.

1653
02:40:18 --> 02:40:20
 So,

1654
02:40:20 --> 02:40:23
 these external forms

1655
02:40:23 --> 02:40:28
 are chosen by devotees as per their tastes.

1656
02:40:30 --> 02:40:33
 Somebody likes Hanuman,

1657
02:40:33 --> 02:40:35
 somebody likes Rama,

1658
02:40:35 --> 02:40:37
 somebody likes Krishna,

1659
02:40:37 --> 02:40:40
 somebody likes Dutta.

1660
02:40:41 --> 02:40:45
 The dresses have different colours.

1661
02:40:46 --> 02:40:49
 Similarly, the external forms

1662
02:40:49 --> 02:40:51
 have different qualities.

1663
02:40:51 --> 02:40:53
 The entire humanity,

1664
02:40:53 --> 02:40:57
 each human being is having a specific quality,

1665
02:40:57 --> 02:41:00
 liking for a specific quality.

1666
02:41:00 --> 02:41:04
 As per his liking or her liking,

1667
02:41:04 --> 02:41:07
 the dress can be selected.

1668
02:41:09 --> 02:41:12
 The person wearing that dress,

1669
02:41:12 --> 02:41:15
 all dresses are one and the same.

1670
02:41:15 --> 02:41:18
 But the dress is not the same.

1671
02:41:18 --> 02:41:21
 All dresses are one and the same.

1672
02:41:21 --> 02:41:24
 But there is fascination for dress

1673
02:41:24 --> 02:41:27
 apart from the fascination to the person.

1674
02:41:30 --> 02:41:33
 Even though the wife is fascinated

1675
02:41:33 --> 02:41:36
 to the husband,

1676
02:41:36 --> 02:41:37
 she says,

1677
02:41:37 --> 02:41:40
 you wear this dress,

1678
02:41:40 --> 02:41:43
 this dress will be good for you.

1679
02:41:43 --> 02:41:46
 No, no, no, don't come in this dress.

1680
02:41:46 --> 02:41:48
 This is not happening.

1681
02:41:48 --> 02:41:51
 So, different devotees have fascinations

1682
02:41:51 --> 02:41:53
 for different qualities,

1683
02:41:53 --> 02:41:55
 different behaviours,

1684
02:41:55 --> 02:41:58
 different personalities.

1685
02:41:59 --> 02:42:02
 So, in order to be available

1686
02:42:02 --> 02:42:06
 for every human being of humanity,

1687
02:42:07 --> 02:42:11
 the same God is wearing different dresses

1688
02:42:11 --> 02:42:14
 and since he has the maya power,

1689
02:42:14 --> 02:42:17
 he is becoming also a several persons

1690
02:42:17 --> 02:42:20
 wearing different clothes.

1691
02:42:20 --> 02:42:22
 Now you choose,

1692
02:42:22 --> 02:42:24
 if you like the personality,

1693
02:42:24 --> 02:42:26
 you choose that personality.

1694
02:42:26 --> 02:42:27
 If you like the dress,

1695
02:42:27 --> 02:42:30
 you choose that person wearing dress.

1696
02:42:30 --> 02:42:34
 To cater the likings of all the devotees,

1697
02:42:34 --> 02:42:37
 God has become several.

1698
02:42:37 --> 02:42:40
 Ekaṁ santviprāṁ bhūdhā vadhan.

1699
02:42:43 --> 02:42:47
 So that is for the facility of the devotees.

1700
02:42:51 --> 02:42:54
 The Hinduism

1701
02:42:54 --> 02:42:59
 is the best example

1702
02:43:00 --> 02:43:04
 which looks to cater the likings

1703
02:43:04 --> 02:43:06
 of all the devotees.

1704
02:43:07 --> 02:43:10
 It suits God as per your liking.

1705
02:43:11 --> 02:43:14
 It doesn't force your liking to the God.

1706
02:43:23 --> 02:43:25
 Because in devotion,

1707
02:43:25 --> 02:43:28
 force should not be there.

1708
02:43:28 --> 02:43:31
 Full freedom must be there.

1709
02:43:31 --> 02:43:34
 So, the whole body should be there.

1710
02:43:34 --> 02:43:37
 Full freedom must be there.

1711
02:43:39 --> 02:43:42
 Truth always shines in freedom,

1712
02:43:43 --> 02:43:46
 not in force.

1713
02:43:52 --> 02:43:54
 Okay?

1714
02:43:54 --> 02:43:56
 Yes, Swami.

1715
02:43:57 --> 02:44:00
 One more question is there, shall I ask Swami?

1716
02:44:01 --> 02:44:02
 Okay, Swami.

1717
02:44:02 --> 02:44:05
 This question is from Mrs. Suganya Raman.

1718
02:44:07 --> 02:44:09
 Pāda namaskar, Swamiji.

1719
02:44:10 --> 02:44:12
 In Viṣṇu Sahasranāmam,

1720
02:44:12 --> 02:44:15
 there is a verse when Parvati Devi

1721
02:44:15 --> 02:44:19
 asked about how scholars can chant

1722
02:44:19 --> 02:44:22
 the whole Nāmāvalī without fail.

1723
02:44:23 --> 02:44:25
 Īśvara answers,

1724
02:44:25 --> 02:44:28
 Śrī Rāma Rāma Rāmeti,

1725
02:44:28 --> 02:44:31
 mentioning that the name Rāma

1726
02:44:31 --> 02:44:35
 is equivalent to thousand names of Viṣṇu

1727
02:44:35 --> 02:44:37
 and it can be chanted.

1728
02:44:38 --> 02:44:39
 My question is,

1729
02:44:40 --> 02:44:43
 when Lord Kṛṣṇa was there at that time

1730
02:44:43 --> 02:44:46
 as contemporary human incarnation

1731
02:44:46 --> 02:44:49
 when Viṣṇu Sahasranāmā was given,

1732
02:44:50 --> 02:44:53
 why the previous or past incarnation

1733
02:44:53 --> 02:44:57
 Lord Rāma was mentioned by Īśvara

1734
02:44:57 --> 02:44:59
 at your lotus feet,

1735
02:44:59 --> 02:45:01
 your servant Suganya Rāma?

1736
02:45:01 --> 02:45:02
 Yes.

1737
02:45:02 --> 02:45:04
 Here,

1738
02:45:07 --> 02:45:12
 when Īśvara said Śrī Rāma Rāma Rāmeti,

1739
02:45:15 --> 02:45:16
 he told,

1740
02:45:17 --> 02:45:19
 God Śiva told,

1741
02:45:20 --> 02:45:22
 the name of Rāma

1742
02:45:24 --> 02:45:28
 not in the view of

1743
02:45:29 --> 02:45:31
 the son of Dasaratha,

1744
02:45:35 --> 02:45:37
 he told,

1745
02:45:37 --> 02:45:39
 he took the word Rāma

1746
02:45:40 --> 02:45:42
 in its real sense.

1747
02:45:44 --> 02:45:46
 What is the meaning of Rāma?

1748
02:45:47 --> 02:45:49
 Rāmate iti Rāma,

1749
02:45:50 --> 02:45:52
 Rāmayati iti Rāma.

1750
02:45:54 --> 02:45:56
 He who

1751
02:45:56 --> 02:45:59
 entertains himself is Rāma.

1752
02:46:00 --> 02:46:03
 He who entertains others is Rāma.

1753
02:46:05 --> 02:46:09
 These are the meanings of the word Rāma, word.

1754
02:46:11 --> 02:46:16
 That indicates the root God and the root story.

1755
02:46:17 --> 02:46:19
 Why all this creation came?

1756
02:46:19 --> 02:46:21
 Only for entertainment.

1757
02:46:21 --> 02:46:25
 Not only his self-entertainment,

1758
02:46:25 --> 02:46:27
 he created such a source

1759
02:46:27 --> 02:46:29
 in order to entertain them also

1760
02:46:29 --> 02:46:31
 he created the world.

1761
02:46:34 --> 02:46:36
 To pacify his hunger

1762
02:46:36 --> 02:46:39
 and to pacify the hunger of the family members.

1763
02:46:41 --> 02:46:45
 So the word Rāma there denotes

1764
02:46:46 --> 02:46:49
 the root sense of the God.

1765
02:46:51 --> 02:46:54
 Why God created this world

1766
02:46:55 --> 02:46:58
 and making all this confusion and all this?

1767
02:46:59 --> 02:47:04
 For that the word Rāma answers.

1768
02:47:05 --> 02:47:06
 Rāma means

1769
02:47:06 --> 02:47:09
 he who entertains himself

1770
02:47:09 --> 02:47:11
 Rāmate iti Rāma,

1771
02:47:12 --> 02:47:16
 Rāmayati bhaktan swajana iti Rāma.

1772
02:47:16 --> 02:47:19
 He who entertains his devotees

1773
02:47:19 --> 02:47:21
 is Rāma.

1774
02:47:22 --> 02:47:24
 In that sense

1775
02:47:25 --> 02:47:28
 when God is taken

1776
02:47:29 --> 02:47:32
 all the other thousand names of Vishnu, God

1777
02:47:36 --> 02:47:41
 mean different activities of God.

1778
02:47:42 --> 02:47:45
 And what is the source of all those

1779
02:47:45 --> 02:47:48
 thousand different activities of God?

1780
02:47:49 --> 02:47:51
 This entertainment only.

1781
02:47:54 --> 02:47:56
 Entertainment is the root

1782
02:47:57 --> 02:47:59
 for all the actions of God.

1783
02:48:02 --> 02:48:04
 There is no other purpose

1784
02:48:04 --> 02:48:06
 of any action of God

1785
02:48:06 --> 02:48:08
 except entertainment.

1786
02:48:09 --> 02:48:11
 We do several activities

1787
02:48:11 --> 02:48:13
 one activity to do job

1788
02:48:13 --> 02:48:15
 and to fill our stomach

1789
02:48:16 --> 02:48:18
 different purposes

1790
02:48:18 --> 02:48:19
 but for God

1791
02:48:20 --> 02:48:22
 any activity of God

1792
02:48:22 --> 02:48:24
 has only one purpose

1793
02:48:24 --> 02:48:26
 that is to entertain.

1794
02:48:27 --> 02:48:29
 To entertain himself

1795
02:48:30 --> 02:48:32
 and to entertain his devotees

1796
02:48:32 --> 02:48:34
 also simultaneously.

1797
02:48:35 --> 02:48:37
 Devotees are also entertained.

1798
02:48:40 --> 02:48:43
 So that is the root

1799
02:48:43 --> 02:48:45
 the root essence of

1800
02:48:46 --> 02:48:49
 the all the activities of God

1801
02:48:50 --> 02:48:52
 all the activities means

1802
02:48:52 --> 02:48:54
 all the names of God.

1803
02:48:55 --> 02:48:58
 So the root essence of all the names of God

1804
02:48:58 --> 02:49:00
 must be Rāma only.

1805
02:49:02 --> 02:49:05
 There even Kṛṣṇa doing

1806
02:49:05 --> 02:49:07
 any activity contemporary

1807
02:49:08 --> 02:49:10
 is only Rāma.

1808
02:49:10 --> 02:49:13
 In fact than Rāma

1809
02:49:14 --> 02:49:16
 Kṛṣṇa is more entertained

1810
02:49:17 --> 02:49:19
 by his so many lilas.

1811
02:49:22 --> 02:49:24
 So the son of Dasaratha

1812
02:49:25 --> 02:49:27
 Rāma is not actual Rāma

1813
02:49:27 --> 02:49:29
 Kṛṣṇa is Rāma

1814
02:49:29 --> 02:49:31
 actual Rāma.

1815
02:49:32 --> 02:49:34
 You know the meaning of the word Rāma

1816
02:49:35 --> 02:49:37
 you will find that is why

1817
02:49:37 --> 02:49:39
 God Śiva told

1818
02:49:39 --> 02:49:41
 that sentence.

1819
02:49:42 --> 02:49:43
 Okay?

1820
02:49:45 --> 02:49:47
 Yes Swami

1821
02:49:51 --> 02:49:53
 In Bhakti Sāhitya also

1822
02:49:53 --> 02:49:55
 many of the gurus

1823
02:49:55 --> 02:49:56
 worldly gurus

1824
02:49:56 --> 02:49:58
 took Rāma Shabda

1825
02:49:58 --> 02:50:01
 as a substitute for God

1826
02:50:01 --> 02:50:03
 not for Dasaratha Putra Rāma

1827
02:50:03 --> 02:50:05
 like Kabirdas

1828
02:50:05 --> 02:50:07
 and all other Jnana Shri Ishaaka devotee

1829
02:50:07 --> 02:50:09
 right Kabir

1830
02:50:10 --> 02:50:12
 The Tharaka Mantra is Rāma

1831
02:50:14 --> 02:50:16
 Tharaka Mantra they say

1832
02:50:16 --> 02:50:18
 Tharaka Mantram

1833
02:50:18 --> 02:50:20
 Kūrīna durake nu

1834
02:50:20 --> 02:50:22
 Tūnyudanai tīni

1835
02:50:22 --> 02:50:24
 Kūrannā

1836
02:50:25 --> 02:50:26
 Tharaka Mantram

1837
02:50:26 --> 02:50:28
 Tharaka Mantram means

1838
02:50:28 --> 02:50:30
 that which

1839
02:50:30 --> 02:50:32
 makes you to cross this world

1840
02:50:32 --> 02:50:34
 this

1841
02:50:34 --> 02:50:36
 pain suffering of the world

1842
02:50:37 --> 02:50:39
 that is

1843
02:50:39 --> 02:50:41
 if you take that

1844
02:50:41 --> 02:50:43
 essence of Rāma in you also

1845
02:50:44 --> 02:50:46
 suppose you feel everything as

1846
02:50:46 --> 02:50:48
 entertainment

1847
02:50:48 --> 02:50:50
 no pain

1848
02:50:50 --> 02:50:52
 no suffering

1849
02:50:52 --> 02:50:54
 let anything happen

1850
02:50:54 --> 02:50:56
 entertain

1851
02:50:56 --> 02:50:58
 yourself

1852
02:50:58 --> 02:51:00
 where is the sorrow?

1853
02:51:00 --> 02:51:02
 See world is going

1854
02:51:02 --> 02:51:04
 on its own lines

1855
02:51:04 --> 02:51:06
 by

1856
02:51:06 --> 02:51:08
 paining yourself by suffering

1857
02:51:08 --> 02:51:10
 that is not going to change

1858
02:51:10 --> 02:51:12
 instead of

1859
02:51:12 --> 02:51:14
 paining

1860
02:51:14 --> 02:51:16
 if you entertain

1861
02:51:16 --> 02:51:18
 the world will go anyway

1862
02:51:18 --> 02:51:20
 constantly like that only

1863
02:51:20 --> 02:51:22
 you are

1864
02:51:22 --> 02:51:24
 relieved from sorrow and pain

1865
02:51:24 --> 02:51:26
 that is called

1866
02:51:26 --> 02:51:28
 Moksha

1867
02:51:28 --> 02:51:30
 that is the liberation

1868
02:51:30 --> 02:51:32
 what is liberation? Liberation from sorrow

1869
02:51:32 --> 02:51:34
 liberation from suffering

1870
02:51:34 --> 02:51:36
 liberation from pain

1871
02:51:38 --> 02:51:40
 everything

1872
02:51:42 --> 02:51:44
 is according to you

1873
02:51:44 --> 02:51:46
 the

1874
02:51:46 --> 02:51:48
 deeds, your deeds

1875
02:51:50 --> 02:51:52
 every suffering is according

1876
02:51:52 --> 02:51:54
 to your deeds

1877
02:51:56 --> 02:51:58
 they are inevitable

1878
02:52:00 --> 02:52:02
 when they are inevitable enjoy

1879
02:52:02 --> 02:52:04
 there is a saying

1880
02:52:06 --> 02:52:08
 when great is inevitable enjoy it

1881
02:52:12 --> 02:52:14
 when the karma phalas

1882
02:52:14 --> 02:52:16
 when the

1883
02:52:16 --> 02:52:18
 fruits of the deeds done in the past

1884
02:52:18 --> 02:52:20
 either in the past life

1885
02:52:20 --> 02:52:22
 or in the past births

1886
02:52:22 --> 02:52:24
 you have to undergo the

1887
02:52:24 --> 02:52:26
 fruits

1888
02:52:26 --> 02:52:28
 whether good fruits or bad fruits

1889
02:52:28 --> 02:52:30
 they are inevitable

1890
02:52:32 --> 02:52:34
 when they are inevitable why do you suffer?

1891
02:52:34 --> 02:52:36
 you enjoy

1892
02:52:38 --> 02:52:40
 by suffering

1893
02:52:40 --> 02:52:42
 yourself by getting

1894
02:52:42 --> 02:52:44
 pain they are not going to be

1895
02:52:44 --> 02:52:46
 avoided

1896
02:52:46 --> 02:52:48
 they are inevitable

1897
02:52:48 --> 02:52:50
 that is what is

1898
02:52:50 --> 02:52:52
 called as Nithyanandaha

1899
02:52:54 --> 02:52:56
 always blissful

1900
02:52:56 --> 02:52:58
 Akhanda Satchidananda Surupa

1901
02:53:00 --> 02:53:02
 the ananda the bliss

1902
02:53:02 --> 02:53:04
 what is the

1903
02:53:04 --> 02:53:06
 difference between happiness and

1904
02:53:06 --> 02:53:08
 bliss you know?

1905
02:53:08 --> 02:53:10
 some people think

1906
02:53:10 --> 02:53:12
 bliss is very large

1907
02:53:12 --> 02:53:14
 thing

1908
02:53:14 --> 02:53:16
 happiness is small thing

1909
02:53:18 --> 02:53:20
 that is what they think

1910
02:53:20 --> 02:53:22
 that is not correct

1911
02:53:22 --> 02:53:24
 Anandaha means

1912
02:53:24 --> 02:53:26
 the upasarga

1913
02:53:26 --> 02:53:28
 samantatandatiti anandaha

1914
02:53:30 --> 02:53:32
 that is continuously happiness is

1915
02:53:32 --> 02:53:34
 bliss

1916
02:53:36 --> 02:53:38
 happiness is 10 units

1917
02:53:38 --> 02:53:40
 bliss is 1000 units

1918
02:53:40 --> 02:53:42
 it is wrong

1919
02:53:44 --> 02:53:46
 what is bliss? what is ananda?

1920
02:53:46 --> 02:53:48
 a samantat

1921
02:53:48 --> 02:53:50
 continuously

1922
02:53:50 --> 02:53:52
 nandati happy is

1923
02:53:52 --> 02:53:54
 ananda

1924
02:53:56 --> 02:53:58
 you should not have a break in the happiness

1925
02:54:00 --> 02:54:02
 you should be continuously happy

1926
02:54:04 --> 02:54:06
 when it will happen?

1927
02:54:08 --> 02:54:10
 when you are

1928
02:54:10 --> 02:54:12
 not attached to the fruits

1929
02:54:12 --> 02:54:14
 of the deeds

1930
02:54:14 --> 02:54:16
 and you are continuously happy

1931
02:54:16 --> 02:54:18
 that is ananda

1932
02:54:18 --> 02:54:20
 that is bliss

1933
02:54:20 --> 02:54:22
 it is not in the quantity of happiness

1934
02:54:24 --> 02:54:26
 it is the continuity of happiness

1935
02:54:26 --> 02:54:28
 I have told this

1936
02:54:28 --> 02:54:30
 in jnana also

1937
02:54:32 --> 02:54:34
 so that continuous happiness is bliss

1938
02:54:34 --> 02:54:36
 ananda

1939
02:54:36 --> 02:54:38
 a samantat means kala vachaka

1940
02:54:38 --> 02:54:40
 that relates to time

1941
02:54:40 --> 02:54:42
 not parimana

1942
02:54:42 --> 02:54:44
 not the quantity

1943
02:54:46 --> 02:54:48
 because happiness

1944
02:54:48 --> 02:54:50
 if it grows in its intensity

1945
02:54:50 --> 02:54:52
 quantity the fellow will die

1946
02:54:54 --> 02:54:56
 every human being

1947
02:54:56 --> 02:54:58
 cannot enjoy happiness

1948
02:54:58 --> 02:55:00
 beyond certain limits

1949
02:55:02 --> 02:55:04
 100 units have happiness

1950
02:55:04 --> 02:55:06
 anybody can withstand

1951
02:55:08 --> 02:55:10
 if it crosses more than 100 units

1952
02:55:10 --> 02:55:12
 the heart will stop and he will die

1953
02:55:12 --> 02:55:14
 so that quantity has limitation

1954
02:55:18 --> 02:55:20
 so ananda does not mean

1955
02:55:20 --> 02:55:22
 the increased happiness

1956
02:55:22 --> 02:55:24
 increased happiness means

1957
02:55:24 --> 02:55:26
 he will go up

1958
02:55:26 --> 02:55:28
 it is not increased

1959
02:55:28 --> 02:55:30
 a samantat nandati

1960
02:55:30 --> 02:55:32
 a samantat means always

1961
02:55:32 --> 02:55:34
 always happy

1962
02:55:36 --> 02:55:38
 not more

1963
02:55:38 --> 02:55:40
 more than that

1964
02:55:40 --> 02:55:42
 not more

1965
02:55:42 --> 02:55:44
 I am happy more than all of you

1966
02:55:48 --> 02:55:50
 that is not the meaning

1967
02:55:50 --> 02:55:52
 continuous happiness

1968
02:55:52 --> 02:55:54
 never you feel sorrow

1969
02:55:54 --> 02:55:56
 or anything

1970
02:55:58 --> 02:56:00
 let anything happen

1971
02:56:00 --> 02:56:02
 you must have heard this story

1972
02:56:02 --> 02:56:04
 one minister

1973
02:56:04 --> 02:56:06
 anything happens

1974
02:56:06 --> 02:56:08
 he was telling

1975
02:56:08 --> 02:56:10
 everything is good

1976
02:56:10 --> 02:56:12
 everything is good for us

1977
02:56:12 --> 02:56:14
 then one day the king's finger was cut

1978
02:56:16 --> 02:56:18
 he told the minister

1979
02:56:18 --> 02:56:20
 everything is good for us

1980
02:56:20 --> 02:56:22
 then the king became angry

1981
02:56:22 --> 02:56:24
 and put him in the prison

1982
02:56:26 --> 02:56:28
 then he went to

1983
02:56:28 --> 02:56:30
 forest for hunting

1984
02:56:32 --> 02:56:34
 then he was caught by some

1985
02:56:34 --> 02:56:36
 forest fellows

1986
02:56:36 --> 02:56:38
 they want to give him sacrifice to

1987
02:56:38 --> 02:56:40
 Kali

1988
02:56:40 --> 02:56:42
 they took him the king there

1989
02:56:42 --> 02:56:44
 then the guru there observed

1990
02:56:44 --> 02:56:46
 his finger is not there

1991
02:56:48 --> 02:56:50
 anybody given as bali to Kali

1992
02:56:50 --> 02:56:52
 must have all parts of the body

1993
02:56:52 --> 02:56:54
 since he is not

1994
02:56:54 --> 02:56:56
 having the finger they left him

1995
02:56:58 --> 02:57:00
 he returned back

1996
02:57:00 --> 02:57:02
 released the minister

1997
02:57:02 --> 02:57:04
 fell on his feet

1998
02:57:04 --> 02:57:06
 what you told is correct

1999
02:57:20 --> 02:57:22
 when Sita was

2000
02:57:22 --> 02:57:24
 stolen by Ravana

2001
02:57:26 --> 02:57:28
 Rama was weeping like anything

2002
02:57:28 --> 02:57:30
 then

2003
02:57:32 --> 02:57:34
 he was going to

2004
02:57:34 --> 02:57:36
 ashram

2005
02:57:36 --> 02:57:38
 one sage asked

2006
02:57:38 --> 02:57:40
 your god Narayana

2007
02:57:40 --> 02:57:42
 why you are weeping

2008
02:57:42 --> 02:57:44
 he told

2009
02:57:44 --> 02:57:46
 Rama means Ramatriya Rama

2010
02:57:46 --> 02:57:48
 he who is entertained is Rama

2011
02:57:48 --> 02:57:50
 I am entertained in my weeping

2012
02:57:50 --> 02:57:52
 because you see

2013
02:57:52 --> 02:57:54
 when you eat haunt dishes

2014
02:57:54 --> 02:57:56
 then also you are entertained

2015
02:57:56 --> 02:57:58
 not only sweet dishes

2016
02:58:00 --> 02:58:02
 I am entertained in the weeping

2017
02:58:02 --> 02:58:04
 who said that I am unhappy

2018
02:58:04 --> 02:58:06
 I am entertained in the weeping

2019
02:58:06 --> 02:58:08
 who said that I am unhappy

2020
02:58:28 --> 02:58:30
 who is my incarnation

2021
02:58:30 --> 02:58:32
 he who is happy

2022
02:58:32 --> 02:58:34
 always

2023
02:58:34 --> 02:58:36
 without a trace of

2024
02:58:36 --> 02:58:38
 pain, suffering, sorrow

2025
02:58:38 --> 02:58:40
 he is my incarnation

2026
02:58:42 --> 02:58:44
 he is my real incarnation

2027
02:58:46 --> 02:58:48
 bhakti ganga

2028
02:58:54 --> 02:58:56
 my true vichanam na sachya gunam

2029
02:58:56 --> 02:58:58
 vichanam na sachya gunam

2030
02:58:58 --> 02:59:00
 vichanam na sachya gunam

2031
02:59:00 --> 02:59:02
 adhigala jivude

2032
02:59:02 --> 02:59:04
 navataram

2033
02:59:04 --> 02:59:06
 my true

2034
02:59:06 --> 02:59:08
 identity

2035
02:59:14 --> 02:59:16
 how much time is it

2036
02:59:16 --> 02:59:18
 6.30

2037
02:59:22 --> 02:59:24
 coffee is

2038
02:59:24 --> 02:59:26
 green tea

2039
02:59:30 --> 02:59:32
 Swami

2040
02:59:32 --> 02:59:34
 one question

2041
02:59:34 --> 02:59:36
 is there Swami

2042
02:59:36 --> 02:59:38
 this question is

2043
02:59:38 --> 02:59:40
 from Sai Sri Nivas

2044
02:59:40 --> 02:59:42
 from Mumbai

2045
02:59:42 --> 02:59:44
 Padanamaskaram Swami

2046
02:59:44 --> 02:59:46
 how can we encounter

2047
02:59:46 --> 02:59:48
 the controversies

2048
02:59:48 --> 02:59:50
 on your previous incarnations

2049
02:59:54 --> 02:59:56
 you see

2050
02:59:56 --> 03:00:03
 They are looking as controversies to your eyes.

2051
03:00:03 --> 03:00:10
 They are looking as different types of entertainments to my eyes.

2052
03:00:10 --> 03:00:16
 See, entertainment also must be different types.

2053
03:00:16 --> 03:00:22
 Same entertainment will also bore.

2054
03:00:22 --> 03:00:37
 So, the original intention of creating this universe is only ekaki naramate, only for entertainment.

2055
03:00:37 --> 03:00:44
 And the situations are developed in such a way that God is entertained.

2056
03:00:44 --> 03:00:58
 But at the same time, if you do deep analysis, whatever God did is justice.

2057
03:00:58 --> 03:01:00
 That is true.

2058
03:01:00 --> 03:01:06
 But there is another statement.

2059
03:01:06 --> 03:01:17
 If you do the deep analysis, whatever is justice, that alone is done by God.

2060
03:01:17 --> 03:01:27
 Because of your petty mind, the inability of understanding of your mind, you are thinking it as injustice.

2061
03:01:27 --> 03:01:31
 I will give an example.

2062
03:01:31 --> 03:01:39
 One should not tell a lie.

2063
03:01:39 --> 03:01:53
 Krishna told Dharmaraja to tell a lie that Ashwathama is killed, so that Drona will be killed.

2064
03:01:53 --> 03:02:02
 By telling a lie, killing a guru like Drona is injustice.

2065
03:02:02 --> 03:02:09
 That is the understanding of Dharmaraja.

2066
03:02:09 --> 03:02:14
 He did not go more deep into the subject.

2067
03:02:14 --> 03:02:23
 But the analysis of Krishna is, Drona is supporting Kavaravas.

2068
03:02:23 --> 03:02:29
 Kavaravas are on the side of injustice.

2069
03:02:29 --> 03:02:42
 And it is very difficult to kill Drona, as long as the bow is in his hand, bow and arrow.

2070
03:02:42 --> 03:02:49
 In Ramavatar also, Vali could not be fought.

2071
03:02:49 --> 03:02:56
 Because anybody who fights with Vali, half strength of the opponent fellow will join the strength of Vali.

2072
03:02:56 --> 03:03:01
 And the strength of Vali is always greater than the strength of the opponent.

2073
03:03:01 --> 03:03:03
 So nobody can defeat Vali.

2074
03:03:03 --> 03:03:07
 But Vali is doing lot of injustice.

2075
03:03:07 --> 03:03:09
 He should be killed.

2076
03:03:09 --> 03:03:12
 Rama killed from behind the tree.

2077
03:03:12 --> 03:03:15
 That is justified.

2078
03:03:15 --> 03:03:21
 Hence justified means,

2079
03:03:21 --> 03:03:27
 hence justified means,

2080
03:03:27 --> 03:03:34
 this is the tear of Subhashchandra Bose.

2081
03:03:34 --> 03:03:42
 In getting the freedom, he prepared army.

2082
03:03:42 --> 03:03:45
 Let us fight with British people.

2083
03:03:45 --> 03:03:47
 Hence justified means.

2084
03:03:47 --> 03:03:51
 But Gandhi told, means justified hence.

2085
03:03:51 --> 03:03:55
 That is the difference between both of them.

2086
03:03:55 --> 03:03:58
 Both are correct.

2087
03:03:58 --> 03:04:04
 Because if you take the case of Vali,

2088
03:04:04 --> 03:04:10
 Rama killing Vali from behind the tree

2089
03:04:10 --> 03:04:14
 is hence justified means.

2090
03:04:14 --> 03:04:17
 Because Vali is unjust,

2091
03:04:17 --> 03:04:21
 killing Vali is justice.

2092
03:04:21 --> 03:04:27
 So killing him from behind the tree,

2093
03:04:27 --> 03:04:31
 that is not injustice.

2094
03:04:31 --> 03:04:38
 Killing a bad fellow through false means is justified.

2095
03:04:38 --> 03:04:42
 There hence justified means.

2096
03:04:42 --> 03:04:47
 Now means justified hence, what Gandhi told.

2097
03:04:47 --> 03:04:51
 That is also correct in different context.

2098
03:04:51 --> 03:04:54
 Suppose taking this example,

2099
03:04:54 --> 03:04:59
 one fellow, such and such fellow is bad,

2100
03:04:59 --> 03:05:02
 because he is my enemy.

2101
03:05:02 --> 03:05:04
 He is not actually bad.

2102
03:05:04 --> 03:05:09
 Because he is my enemy, he is bad.

2103
03:05:09 --> 03:05:12
 So just like Rama killed Vali,

2104
03:05:12 --> 03:05:17
 let me kill from his backside.

2105
03:05:17 --> 03:05:20
 He may exploit.

2106
03:05:20 --> 03:05:24
 Hence justified means.

2107
03:05:24 --> 03:05:29
 In order to prevent it, means justified hence.

2108
03:05:29 --> 03:05:33
 Okay, you think that he is bad,

2109
03:05:33 --> 03:05:35
 then fight before him.

2110
03:05:35 --> 03:05:39
 Why do you kill him from the backside?

2111
03:05:39 --> 03:05:46
 If he fights with him before, he cannot defeat him.

2112
03:05:46 --> 03:05:52
 So there means justified hence.

2113
03:05:52 --> 03:05:58
 So that hence justified means is not exploited.

2114
03:06:03 --> 03:06:21
 So you think that Krishna is wrong in saying to Dharmaraja

2115
03:06:21 --> 03:06:25
 that he should tell a lie to kill Drona.

2116
03:06:25 --> 03:06:31
 These things you take as contradictions.

2117
03:06:32 --> 03:06:34
 Of Dharma.

2118
03:06:34 --> 03:06:39
 It is not a contradiction of Dharma, it is Dharma.

2119
03:06:39 --> 03:06:42
 Not because God has done, it is Dharma.

2120
03:06:42 --> 03:06:47
 Even by analysis it is Dharma.

2121
03:06:47 --> 03:06:52
 He is supporting Kauravas.

2122
03:06:52 --> 03:06:55
 And unless he is killed, Kauravas cannot be killed.

2123
03:06:55 --> 03:07:00
 If Kauravas are not killed, injustice is not destroyed.

2124
03:07:00 --> 03:07:06
 Pandavas will not win, justice cannot be established.

2125
03:07:06 --> 03:07:10
 So what you feel as atrocity,

2126
03:07:10 --> 03:07:13
 that is correct even on analysis.

2127
03:07:13 --> 03:07:15
 Because you are unable to analyze,

2128
03:07:15 --> 03:07:21
 you are talking as atrocities of the previous incarnations.

2129
03:07:21 --> 03:07:28
 Previous incarnations mean same God as the previous incarnations.

2130
03:07:28 --> 03:07:34
 You are criticizing the present God also about the past incarnations.

2131
03:07:36 --> 03:07:38
 Past incarnations are only dresses.

2132
03:07:39 --> 03:07:41
 The present incarnation is the person.

2133
03:07:43 --> 03:07:48
 You are criticizing the bearer of the shirt, not the shirt.

2134
03:07:52 --> 03:07:57
 So it is due to lack of the depth of your analysis,

2135
03:07:57 --> 03:08:00
 they appear as atrocities.

2136
03:08:00 --> 03:08:04
 How do you support those previous atrocities?

2137
03:08:04 --> 03:08:06
 You are putting first.

2138
03:08:06 --> 03:08:08
 They are not atrocities at all.

2139
03:08:08 --> 03:08:15
 They appeared as atrocities because of the lack of your intelligence,

2140
03:08:15 --> 03:08:20
 the lack of your analysis, the lack of your deep analysis.

2141
03:08:20 --> 03:08:24
 Followed?

2142
03:08:24 --> 03:08:25
 Yes.

2143
03:08:30 --> 03:08:30
 Thank you Swami.

2144
03:08:32 --> 03:08:35
 Swami, I have a question completely related to pravritti.

2145
03:08:36 --> 03:08:40
 All householders often follow traditions of the society,

2146
03:08:40 --> 03:08:42
 thinking that that is only justice.

2147
03:08:43 --> 03:08:49
 They are expected to give money or varti gifts at marriages and other functions of the family.

2148
03:08:50 --> 03:08:53
 Those families already have enough wealth.

2149
03:08:54 --> 03:08:58
 Even a family member with low income is bound to give costly gifts,

2150
03:08:58 --> 03:09:00
 otherwise prestige is lost.

2151
03:09:01 --> 03:09:07
 Even if good clothes or jewelry are not worn, people do bad comments and upset us.

2152
03:09:07 --> 03:09:13
 So people are running after money to stand along with their peers in the society.

2153
03:09:13 --> 03:09:19
 Now how to divert the time and effort to God in this societal pressure of earning money?

2154
03:09:19 --> 03:09:27
 Sometimes in the present invitation cards, no gifts are accepted.

2155
03:09:29 --> 03:09:32
 They are putting no gifts.

2156
03:09:32 --> 03:09:33
 No gifts are accepted.

2157
03:09:37 --> 03:09:38
 Nobody is there putting gifts.

2158
03:09:38 --> 03:09:40
 See, the thing is everything is business.

2159
03:09:41 --> 03:09:43
 Pravritti is only business.

2160
03:09:43 --> 03:09:46
 You are going to the marriage function.

2161
03:09:46 --> 03:09:48
 You are taking meals.

2162
03:09:49 --> 03:09:50
 What is the cost of that meals?

2163
03:09:55 --> 03:09:56
 100 rupees.

2164
03:09:56 --> 03:09:59
 Or if you go to a hotel, some 200, 300 it may take.

2165
03:10:00 --> 03:10:06
 You 300 cash and come back.

2166
03:10:09 --> 03:10:10
 He will come to your function.

2167
03:10:12 --> 03:10:16
 He will also take meals and you.

2168
03:10:16 --> 03:10:24
 Of course, you must compare how many items you have eaten there

2169
03:10:24 --> 03:10:26
 and how many items you have prepared here.

2170
03:10:27 --> 03:10:28
 There should be justice.

2171
03:10:29 --> 03:10:31
 It is all business only.

2172
03:10:31 --> 03:10:36
 It is not love, real love.

2173
03:10:40 --> 03:10:45
 Real love lies when you are in love.

2174
03:10:46 --> 03:10:50
 When you present something without any expectation in return.

2175
03:10:54 --> 03:10:57
 If you give anything to me, nothing will be returned back.

2176
03:11:03 --> 03:11:10
 If you have true love, I am the best person for true love

2177
03:11:10 --> 03:11:12
 because nothing will be returned back.

2178
03:11:12 --> 03:11:16
 The true love also will come out.

2179
03:11:18 --> 03:11:19
 Its reality will come out.

2180
03:11:20 --> 03:11:21
 We all love you, Swami.

2181
03:11:21 --> 03:11:24
 I am telling you just an example.

2182
03:11:27 --> 03:11:33
 Without aspiring anything in return, you must present that it is true love.

2183
03:11:34 --> 03:11:38
 But you give a silver tumbler.

2184
03:11:40 --> 03:11:41
 They give you a silver plate.

2185
03:11:43 --> 03:11:43
 You compare.

2186
03:11:44 --> 03:11:45
 Our tumbler is bigger.

2187
03:11:47 --> 03:11:48
 This plate is smaller.

2188
03:11:52 --> 03:11:53
 What is the use of such a gift?

2189
03:11:58 --> 03:12:00
 It is all pure business.

2190
03:12:02 --> 03:12:03
 Nothing else.

2191
03:12:04 --> 03:12:06
 Only before God, the real devotion comes.

2192
03:12:07 --> 03:12:10
 There is no devotion between the human beings.

2193
03:12:11 --> 03:12:13
 There is no real love between the human beings.

2194
03:12:15 --> 03:12:22
 The real love becomes, the word real love becomes meaningful only in the context of God.

2195
03:12:26 --> 03:12:28
 Not in the context of pravrti.

2196
03:12:29 --> 03:12:31
 Only in nivrti it is correct.

2197
03:12:32 --> 03:12:36
 Because in Yajnavalkya says,

2198
03:12:36 --> 03:12:44
 Yajnavalkya in Veda says that the loves of all these worldly bonds are false.

2199
03:12:45 --> 03:12:46
 They are not true.

2200
03:12:47 --> 03:12:54
 A husband loves wife because she is giving happiness to him.

2201
03:12:58 --> 03:13:03
 A wife loves the husband because he is giving happiness to her.

2202
03:13:07 --> 03:13:10
 Atmanakkamaya sarvampriyambhavati,

2203
03:13:12 --> 03:13:13
 ari pachyurva.

2204
03:13:14 --> 03:13:16
 Whatever I told is told in Veda.

2205
03:13:20 --> 03:13:27
 So all the worldly loves are fraud.

2206
03:13:27 --> 03:13:37
 But God loves the devotee because he loves somebody who is giving happiness to him.

2207
03:13:42 --> 03:13:44
 But if you take God as a devotee,

2208
03:13:48 --> 03:13:49
 God loves the devotee,

2209
03:13:52 --> 03:13:56
 but God doesn't expect any happiness from the devotee.

2210
03:13:56 --> 03:13:58
 He is already full of happiness.

2211
03:13:59 --> 03:14:00
 He is full of bliss.

2212
03:14:03 --> 03:14:06
 What kind of happiness he requires from a devotee?

2213
03:14:07 --> 03:14:09
 That he is devotion of bliss.

2214
03:14:13 --> 03:14:16
 The devotee will get happiness from the God,

2215
03:14:17 --> 03:14:22
 but God need not get any happiness from any devotee, any human being, any soul.

2216
03:14:22 --> 03:14:25
 And when God loves the devotee, that is true love.

2217
03:14:28 --> 03:14:32
 Because there is no expectation of any happiness in return.

2218
03:14:35 --> 03:14:41
 But what devotee by worshipping God, he expects some happiness from God through some boon.

2219
03:14:42 --> 03:14:47
 So only in the nivruthi, in the context of God and devotee,

2220
03:14:50 --> 03:14:56
 you will find true love, that too from the side of God only.

2221
03:15:00 --> 03:15:04
 When a person is in love with God,

2222
03:15:05 --> 03:15:18
 when a person is loving you without aspiring anything from you,

2223
03:15:20 --> 03:15:23
 should you not behave in the same way towards the other person also?

2224
03:15:24 --> 03:15:25
 Is it not justified?

2225
03:15:28 --> 03:15:30
 Then why you aspire from God?

2226
03:15:30 --> 03:15:33
 Show me any person who is not aspiring from God.

2227
03:15:35 --> 03:15:36
 Everybody is aspiring.

2228
03:15:37 --> 03:15:42
 If you put one coconut, if you break one coconut, he aspires something.

2229
03:15:45 --> 03:15:47
 That water has gone on the floor.

2230
03:15:48 --> 03:15:52
 Those two halves have gone into your idli chutney.

2231
03:15:52 --> 03:15:54
 In fact, nothing you have done to God.

2232
03:15:57 --> 03:16:02
 Where is the scope for you to aspire from God?

2233
03:16:03 --> 03:16:04
 What you have given to God?

2234
03:16:05 --> 03:16:12
 That sound of breaking the coconut, which is also not sweet, which is very harsh.

2235
03:16:13 --> 03:16:20
 That sound of breaking the coconut, which is also not sweet, which is very harsh.

2236
03:16:27 --> 03:16:30
 We have no right to aspire anything from God.

2237
03:16:33 --> 03:16:40
 And because he loves truly us, we must sacrifice to God.

2238
03:16:40 --> 03:16:43
 You must reward the true love.

2239
03:16:45 --> 03:16:47
 You are rewarding false love in the world.

2240
03:16:49 --> 03:16:52
 You are not rewarding the true love of God.

2241
03:16:52 --> 03:16:53
 What?

2242
03:16:57 --> 03:16:57
 Is it not?

2243
03:17:09 --> 03:17:17
 One husband took bath in the tank and came inside the house

2244
03:17:18 --> 03:17:25
 and lied on the floor, acted like as if he is dead.

2245
03:17:30 --> 03:17:33
 The wife, you know, he did not rise.

2246
03:17:35 --> 03:17:38
 So I weep now, all the people will come.

2247
03:17:38 --> 03:17:42
 But inside the kitchen, just now the cooking is over.

2248
03:17:42 --> 03:17:51
 Some curry and some tomato sambar already prepared.

2249
03:17:53 --> 03:18:00
 She closed the doors, went inside the kitchen, ate all those.

2250
03:18:01 --> 03:18:04
 Then washed, wiped her mouth.

2251
03:18:04 --> 03:18:07
 Then opened the doors and started weeping.

2252
03:18:10 --> 03:18:13
 All the relatives, neighbors thinking.

2253
03:18:16 --> 03:18:17
 She is weeping.

2254
03:18:18 --> 03:18:22
 For you, I have prepared all the items in the kitchen.

2255
03:18:23 --> 03:18:25
 Without you, you think you have gone.

2256
03:18:27 --> 03:18:31
 Then the husband stood and started weeping.

2257
03:18:32 --> 03:18:34
 Then the husband stood.

2258
03:18:34 --> 03:18:36
 Just now you have eaten.

2259
03:18:51 --> 03:18:55
 In Coimbatore, I have said, when somebody dies in the house,

2260
03:18:55 --> 03:18:57
 people will be weeping.

2261
03:18:57 --> 03:19:01
 And the relatives, friends, etc., they come and sit.

2262
03:19:03 --> 03:19:05
 They also start weeping, joining with them.

2263
03:19:09 --> 03:19:11
 So many people will be weeping.

2264
03:19:13 --> 03:19:15
 I was also there.

2265
03:19:15 --> 03:19:19
 One lady is asking, the side lady, is anything prepared or not?

2266
03:19:25 --> 03:19:33
 When the other lady told,

2267
03:19:33 --> 03:19:35
 Upma is prepared.

2268
03:19:37 --> 03:19:39
 Then she started weeping.

2269
03:19:43 --> 03:19:45
 Actually I have seen.

2270
03:19:45 --> 03:19:47
 I have seen this.

2271
03:19:55 --> 03:20:01
 So, is it over?

2272
03:20:01 --> 03:20:03
 Any more questions?

2273
03:20:05 --> 03:20:07
 Actually our time is half an hour.

2274
03:20:09 --> 03:20:11
 Yes, Swami. It is already half an hour.

2275
03:20:11 --> 03:20:13
 We are at 6 o'clock.

2276
03:20:13 --> 03:20:17
 Yes, but still if any question is there, I don't mind to answer.

2277
03:20:19 --> 03:20:21
 Okay, Swami.

2278
03:20:25 --> 03:20:29
 So, Swami, when Pandavas won the war, they got...

2279
03:20:29 --> 03:20:31
 One thing.

2280
03:20:31 --> 03:20:35
 You put one year only, that gold.

2281
03:20:35 --> 03:20:37
 Or both years.

2282
03:20:37 --> 03:20:39
 One.

2283
03:20:39 --> 03:20:43
 N.T. Ramarov did like that to become Chief Minister.

2284
03:20:47 --> 03:20:49
 So our next Chief Minister...

2285
03:20:49 --> 03:20:55
 I will be very attentive to answer your question.

2286
03:20:55 --> 03:20:57
 Tell me.

2287
03:20:59 --> 03:21:01
 Tell me.

2288
03:21:01 --> 03:21:03
 Swami, when Pandavas won the war,

2289
03:21:05 --> 03:21:07
 with the help of Lord Krishna,

2290
03:21:07 --> 03:21:11
 Lord Krishna, after helping them,

2291
03:21:11 --> 03:21:13
 he went to his kingdom.

2292
03:21:13 --> 03:21:15
 He did not aspire for a single penny.

2293
03:21:15 --> 03:21:17
 And it is told that when

2294
03:21:17 --> 03:21:19
 money ends through Adharma,

2295
03:21:19 --> 03:21:21
 we should not enjoy it.

2296
03:21:21 --> 03:21:23
 And instead of that, we should give that wealth

2297
03:21:23 --> 03:21:25
 to the welfare of the society.

2298
03:21:25 --> 03:21:27
 Swami ji, here one context is that

2299
03:21:27 --> 03:21:29
 even Arjuna fought for his righteous share.

2300
03:21:29 --> 03:21:31
 Suppose in this Kali Yuga,

2301
03:21:31 --> 03:21:33
 if a person ends in justified means of 100 rupees,

2302
03:21:33 --> 03:21:35
 at least one month,

2303
03:21:35 --> 03:21:37
 he should not enjoy it.

2304
03:21:37 --> 03:21:39
 And if he does not enjoy it,

2305
03:21:39 --> 03:21:41
 he should not enjoy it.

2306
03:21:41 --> 03:21:44
 So, when he is in the state of

2307
03:21:44 --> 03:21:46
 end of in justified means of 100 rupees,

2308
03:21:46 --> 03:21:48
 at least one paisa, ten paisa will be there

2309
03:21:48 --> 03:21:50
 and injustice.

2310
03:21:50 --> 03:21:52
 In that case,

2311
03:21:52 --> 03:21:54
 only

2312
03:21:56 --> 03:21:58
 by increasing devotion

2313
03:21:58 --> 03:22:00
 and knowledge,

2314
03:22:00 --> 03:22:02
 we can give that money

2315
03:22:02 --> 03:22:04
 to human incarnation of

2316
03:22:04 --> 03:22:06
 God.

2317
03:22:06 --> 03:22:08
 We can...

2318
03:22:08 --> 03:22:10
 So, in that case,

2319
03:22:10 --> 03:22:12
 that money will not be

2320
03:22:12 --> 03:22:14
 useful, no, Swami ji, because anyhow

2321
03:22:14 --> 03:22:16
 in Kali Yuga,

2322
03:22:16 --> 03:22:18
 the money, if we give to our

2323
03:22:18 --> 03:22:20
 like children

2324
03:22:20 --> 03:22:22
 and all issues, anyhow

2325
03:22:22 --> 03:22:24
 it is going to

2326
03:22:24 --> 03:22:26
 waste our

2327
03:22:26 --> 03:22:28
 like

2328
03:22:28 --> 03:22:30
 that is going to be

2329
03:22:30 --> 03:22:32
 unjust to them, right?

2330
03:22:32 --> 03:22:34
 That is,

2331
03:22:34 --> 03:22:36
 human incarnation,

2332
03:22:36 --> 03:22:38
 as he is an Agni,

2333
03:22:38 --> 03:22:40
 he is a truth

2334
03:22:40 --> 03:22:42
 and he is human incarnation,

2335
03:22:42 --> 03:22:44
 so,

2336
03:22:44 --> 03:22:46
 we should give it to him.

2337
03:22:46 --> 03:22:48
 We should give it

2338
03:22:48 --> 03:22:50
 and all are no questions.

2339
03:22:50 --> 03:22:52
 See, here,

2340
03:22:56 --> 03:22:58
 God Krishna

2341
03:22:58 --> 03:23:00
 took the

2342
03:23:00 --> 03:23:02
 Mahabharata war

2343
03:23:02 --> 03:23:04
 as his work.

2344
03:23:06 --> 03:23:08
 That is, to establish

2345
03:23:08 --> 03:23:10
 justice

2346
03:23:10 --> 03:23:12
 and to destroy injustice.

2347
03:23:14 --> 03:23:16
 And his work

2348
03:23:16 --> 03:23:18
 was assisted by Pandavas.

2349
03:23:18 --> 03:23:20
 He should pay to

2350
03:23:20 --> 03:23:22
 Pandavas.

2351
03:23:24 --> 03:23:26
 Not Pandavas give to Krishna.

2352
03:23:28 --> 03:23:30
 Krishna should give to Pandavas.

2353
03:23:32 --> 03:23:34
 Because what he tells,

2354
03:23:34 --> 03:23:36
 this is my work.

2355
03:23:36 --> 03:23:38
 First, Arjuna thinks

2356
03:23:38 --> 03:23:40
 that he is fighting

2357
03:23:40 --> 03:23:42
 for his selfish purpose,

2358
03:23:42 --> 03:23:44
 to earn his

2359
03:23:44 --> 03:23:46
 justified share.

2360
03:23:48 --> 03:23:50
 I don't want that share.

2361
03:23:50 --> 03:23:52
 I cannot kill my grandfather.

2362
03:23:52 --> 03:23:54
 That was his argument.

2363
03:23:56 --> 03:23:58
 Then how Krishna

2364
03:23:58 --> 03:24:00
 turned on that concept?

2365
03:24:00 --> 03:24:02
 He told,

2366
03:24:02 --> 03:24:04
 you fellow, this is not your work.

2367
03:24:04 --> 03:24:06
 Even if you go out of the war,

2368
03:24:06 --> 03:24:08
 I will kill them.

2369
03:24:16 --> 03:24:18
 Even if you are not fighting,

2370
03:24:18 --> 03:24:20
 I am going to kill them.

2371
03:24:22 --> 03:24:24
 Already I have killed them.

2372
03:24:24 --> 03:24:26
 You kill

2373
03:24:26 --> 03:24:28
 the already killed persons.

2374
03:24:30 --> 03:24:32
 I have killed them.

2375
03:24:32 --> 03:24:34
 Whose work?

2376
03:24:34 --> 03:24:36
 Dharma samsthapan arthaya

2377
03:24:36 --> 03:24:38
 sambhavami yuge yuge

2378
03:24:38 --> 03:24:40
 This is not my

2379
03:24:40 --> 03:24:42
 new work.

2380
03:24:42 --> 03:24:44
 In every yuga,

2381
03:24:44 --> 03:24:46
 I

2382
03:24:46 --> 03:24:48
 incarnated myself

2383
03:24:48 --> 03:24:50
 to destroy injustice.

2384
03:24:52 --> 03:24:54
 Similarly, on the same work,

2385
03:24:54 --> 03:24:56
 I am incarnated now.

2386
03:24:56 --> 03:24:58
 I am doing my work.

2387
03:24:58 --> 03:25:00
 You are not killing them.

2388
03:25:00 --> 03:25:02
 I am killing them.

2389
03:25:02 --> 03:25:04
 I am doing my own work.

2390
03:25:06 --> 03:25:08
 You just assist me,

2391
03:25:08 --> 03:25:10
 appear as if you have assisted me

2392
03:25:10 --> 03:25:12
 and get the fee.

2393
03:25:22 --> 03:25:24
 Already I have killed them.

2394
03:25:24 --> 03:25:26
 They are unjust people.

2395
03:25:26 --> 03:25:28
 So,

2396
03:25:28 --> 03:25:30
 you participate

2397
03:25:30 --> 03:25:32
 in my work,

2398
03:25:32 --> 03:25:34
 being my devotee.

2399
03:25:34 --> 03:25:36
 In that case,

2400
03:25:36 --> 03:25:38
 God is greater

2401
03:25:38 --> 03:25:40
 than your grandfather.

2402
03:25:42 --> 03:25:44
 You must be prepared to kill

2403
03:25:44 --> 03:25:46
 the grandfather for the sake of God.

2404
03:25:48 --> 03:25:50
 Don't kill your grandfather

2405
03:25:50 --> 03:25:52
 for your sake.

2406
03:25:52 --> 03:25:54
 To get the right share

2407
03:25:54 --> 03:25:56
 of the property,

2408
03:25:56 --> 03:25:58
 then Arjuna is killing

2409
03:25:58 --> 03:26:00
 grandfather for his share,

2410
03:26:00 --> 03:26:02
 for his work.

2411
03:26:04 --> 03:26:06
 Now,

2412
03:26:06 --> 03:26:08
 I am destroying injustice.

2413
03:26:10 --> 03:26:12
 Bhishma is supporting unjust

2414
03:26:12 --> 03:26:14
 kauravas.

2415
03:26:14 --> 03:26:16
 You kill

2416
03:26:16 --> 03:26:18
 your grandfather

2417
03:26:18 --> 03:26:20
 for my sake. I am greater than your grandfather.

2418
03:26:24 --> 03:26:26
 That is how he turned the entire

2419
03:26:26 --> 03:26:28
 angle of Mahabharata war.

2420
03:26:30 --> 03:26:32
 Then Arjuna

2421
03:26:32 --> 03:26:34
 killed Bhishma,

2422
03:26:34 --> 03:26:36
 killed Drona,

2423
03:26:36 --> 03:26:38
 the teacher.

2424
03:26:38 --> 03:26:40
 The grandfather and the teacher

2425
03:26:40 --> 03:26:42
 are not greater

2426
03:26:42 --> 03:26:44
 than God Krishna.

2427
03:26:44 --> 03:26:46
 Now, this war

2428
03:26:46 --> 03:26:48
 is my work.

2429
03:26:48 --> 03:26:50
 You are assisting

2430
03:26:50 --> 03:26:52
 me in my work.

2431
03:26:54 --> 03:26:56
 Not your work.

2432
03:26:56 --> 03:26:58
 Since it is my work,

2433
03:26:58 --> 03:27:00
 you will not get anything.

2434
03:27:02 --> 03:27:04
 If you are killing Bhishma

2435
03:27:04 --> 03:27:06
 for this, earning your

2436
03:27:06 --> 03:27:08
 share of the kingdom

2437
03:27:08 --> 03:27:10
 for the sake of money, property

2438
03:27:10 --> 03:27:12
 means money, then it is

2439
03:27:12 --> 03:27:14
 a sin.

2440
03:27:14 --> 03:27:16
 For your selfishness,

2441
03:27:16 --> 03:27:18
 you have killed the grandfather.

2442
03:27:18 --> 03:27:20
 But now,

2443
03:27:20 --> 03:27:22
 I am going to kill

2444
03:27:22 --> 03:27:24
 kauravas because they are

2445
03:27:24 --> 03:27:26
 on the side of

2446
03:27:26 --> 03:27:28
 injustice.

2447
03:27:28 --> 03:27:30
 This is my work.

2448
03:27:30 --> 03:27:32
 You are helping me

2449
03:27:32 --> 03:27:34
 as my servant, as my

2450
03:27:34 --> 03:27:36
 devotee.

2451
03:27:36 --> 03:27:38
 And when you are helping God

2452
03:27:38 --> 03:27:40
 as a devotee

2453
03:27:40 --> 03:27:42
 or as a servant, grandfather

2454
03:27:42 --> 03:27:44
 and teacher are not greater than God.

2455
03:27:44 --> 03:27:46
 You can kill them.

2456
03:27:46 --> 03:27:48
 You killed them.

2457
03:27:50 --> 03:27:52
 That is how Krishna

2458
03:27:52 --> 03:27:54
 turned the angle.

2459
03:27:56 --> 03:27:58
 The angle of Arjuna

2460
03:27:58 --> 03:28:00
 was completely turned.

2461
03:28:04 --> 03:28:06
 And when Sanjaya told

2462
03:28:06 --> 03:28:08
 Dhritarashtra about

2463
03:28:08 --> 03:28:10
 all this Bhagavad Gita,

2464
03:28:10 --> 03:28:12
 Dhritarashtra scolds Krishna,

2465
03:28:12 --> 03:28:14
 that fellow is responsible.

2466
03:28:14 --> 03:28:16
 If that fellow is not there,

2467
03:28:16 --> 03:28:18
 Arjuna would have not fought.

2468
03:28:18 --> 03:28:20
 Then the kingdom

2469
03:28:20 --> 03:28:22
 must have come to my son.

2470
03:28:22 --> 03:28:24
 That fellow is

2471
03:28:24 --> 03:28:26
 the real problem.

2472
03:28:30 --> 03:28:32
 Did you follow

2473
03:28:32 --> 03:28:34
 what I told?

2474
03:28:34 --> 03:28:36
 Swamiji, in every context

2475
03:28:36 --> 03:28:38
 you are telling that intention,

2476
03:28:40 --> 03:28:42
 intention, every fruit

2477
03:28:42 --> 03:28:44
 depends on the intention.

2478
03:28:48 --> 03:28:50
 You see, I am telling in this present

2479
03:28:50 --> 03:28:52
 context, it is the intention

2480
03:28:52 --> 03:28:54
 only that decides the sin,

2481
03:28:54 --> 03:28:56
 the fruit,

2482
03:28:56 --> 03:28:58
 whether it is sin

2483
03:28:58 --> 03:29:00
 or merit.

2484
03:29:00 --> 03:29:02
 If your intention is to serve

2485
03:29:02 --> 03:29:04
 God Krishna

2486
03:29:04 --> 03:29:06
 in his work, then

2487
03:29:06 --> 03:29:08
 the fruit is punyam.

2488
03:29:08 --> 03:29:10
 If your intention

2489
03:29:10 --> 03:29:12
 is to earn your property share

2490
03:29:14 --> 03:29:16
 even by killing grandfather,

2491
03:29:16 --> 03:29:18
 that is sin, that is papa.

2492
03:29:18 --> 03:29:20
 Here also,

2493
03:29:20 --> 03:29:22
 the intention decides

2494
03:29:22 --> 03:29:24
 the fruit.

2495
03:29:24 --> 03:29:26
 If you are fighting

2496
03:29:26 --> 03:29:28
 with the intention

2497
03:29:28 --> 03:29:30
 of getting your share

2498
03:29:30 --> 03:29:32
 by killing

2499
03:29:32 --> 03:29:34
 Bhishma,

2500
03:29:34 --> 03:29:36
 are you following?

2501
03:29:36 --> 03:29:38
 Then

2502
03:29:38 --> 03:29:40
 you know, then

2503
03:29:40 --> 03:29:42
 the fruit is sin.

2504
03:29:44 --> 03:29:46
 If you are killing Bhishma

2505
03:29:46 --> 03:29:48
 with an intention

2506
03:29:48 --> 03:29:50
 to help

2507
03:29:50 --> 03:29:52
 God Krishna in his work

2508
03:29:52 --> 03:29:54
 as his devotee,

2509
03:29:54 --> 03:29:56
 as his servant,

2510
03:29:56 --> 03:30:01
 You are getting punya. It is not a sin.

2511
03:30:01 --> 03:30:05
 So the fruit is depending on the intention only.

2512
03:30:05 --> 03:30:11
 Same Arjuna, same Bhishma, same killing of Bhishma.

2513
03:30:11 --> 03:30:17
 In both sin is same, but intention differs.

2514
03:30:21 --> 03:30:23
 That was what Krishna told.

2515
03:30:24 --> 03:30:27
 Can intention be changed by devotion?

2516
03:30:27 --> 03:30:31
 Means when devotion improves, you reach that stage.

2517
03:30:31 --> 03:30:38
 That is what, because of devotee, as a devotee only, his intention is changed, is it not?

2518
03:30:38 --> 03:30:45
 Because Arjuna is a devotee of Krishna, his intention is changed and he fought the war.

2519
03:30:45 --> 03:30:51
 If Arjuna is not a devotee of Krishna, he will not fight.

2520
03:30:51 --> 03:30:57
 He will go back due to fascination towards his grandfather.

2521
03:30:57 --> 03:31:06
 He has to defeat the worldly bond of grandfather for the sake of God.

2522
03:31:06 --> 03:31:10
 That is the test, dharma pariksha is only that.

2523
03:31:10 --> 03:31:16
 For my sake, which you can sacrifice?

2524
03:31:16 --> 03:31:21
 Fascination to me or fascination to your worldly bond?

2525
03:31:21 --> 03:31:27
 If you sacrifice your worldly bond for my sake, then you have won in the test.

2526
03:31:27 --> 03:31:36
 If you sacrifice me for the sake of the worldly bond, then you fail in the test.

2527
03:31:36 --> 03:31:39
 That is the test of dattas.

2528
03:31:39 --> 03:31:49
 The same Datta test is performed by Krishna who is Datta to Arjuna who is a devotee.

2529
03:31:49 --> 03:31:51
 That is only Datta pariksha.

2530
03:32:10 --> 03:32:12
 What is the time?

2531
03:32:12 --> 03:32:14
 6.40

2532
03:32:14 --> 03:32:17
 So you have crossed the time.

2533
03:32:17 --> 03:32:23
 But still, any question anybody is having, you can ask.

2534
03:32:27 --> 03:32:30
 Swami, this is in context to Ramayana.

2535
03:32:30 --> 03:32:38
 When Lord Hanuman, when he travelled to Lanka, he is considered to be a servant of Rama, his servant.

2536
03:32:38 --> 03:32:48
 So in this context, I and Abhiram were discussing and we had this question that when he went there, while he was coming back, he burnt the Lanka.

2537
03:32:48 --> 03:32:52
 So without the instruction of Rama, he does not do anything.

2538
03:32:52 --> 03:32:58
 Without the instruction of Rama, he does not do anything because he is completely surrendered to him.

2539
03:32:58 --> 03:33:07
 So can he burn the Lanka, I mean burning the Lanka without the instruction of Rama, did he cross his...

2540
03:33:07 --> 03:33:11
 No, instruction means even mental inspiration.

2541
03:33:11 --> 03:33:15
 God can speak through mind also.

2542
03:33:15 --> 03:33:24
 Is it necessary to speak or to phone him and tell him or send email?

2543
03:33:24 --> 03:33:30
 Burn the Lanka, email or phone.

2544
03:33:30 --> 03:33:32
 Is it necessary?

2545
03:33:32 --> 03:33:36
 Rama could have told in his mind.

2546
03:33:36 --> 03:33:46
 God can communicate in any way beyond human ways. Is it not?

2547
03:33:46 --> 03:33:52
 So he burned Lanka based on the instruction of Rama. Can we understand from that?

2548
03:33:52 --> 03:33:56
 No, you see, you can say like that also.

2549
03:33:56 --> 03:34:00
 You can also say since Hanuman is the best devotee of Rama,

2550
03:34:00 --> 03:34:14
 in the interest of, in the true context of true love to Rama, he did that for the sake of the benefit of Rama.

2551
03:34:14 --> 03:34:26
 If Lanka is burnt, the courage of the demons is finished a lot, you know.

2552
03:34:26 --> 03:34:36
 He threatened them. Their courage is reduced. Courage reduced means the strength is reduced.

2553
03:34:36 --> 03:34:40
 The war will be easy.

2554
03:34:40 --> 03:34:48
 So you can think that from the side of devotee or from the side of God Rama.

2555
03:34:48 --> 03:34:57
 Suppose you think that Rama is incapable of sending that Hanuman did not take the permission of Rama,

2556
03:34:57 --> 03:35:03
 then we will answer like this.

2557
03:35:03 --> 03:35:11
 If you say that no, no, Rama did not give instruction but still he did it in the true love of Rama, in the service of Rama.

2558
03:35:11 --> 03:35:16
 Yes, that is correct we will say from the side of the devotee.

2559
03:35:16 --> 03:35:23
 Both are correlating. They are not contradicting.

2560
03:35:23 --> 03:35:29
 Matta, Pachyavara, Kashi, Nasti, Sugrivas and Nidhavu.

2561
03:35:29 --> 03:35:38
 After burning all the Lanka and killing so many demons, he says, I am the weakest monkey.

2562
03:35:38 --> 03:35:45
 I am the weakest monkey.

2563
03:35:45 --> 03:35:52
 If the weakest monkey has done so much, what will be other monkeys?

2564
03:35:52 --> 03:35:56
 What will be the leader of those monkeys, Sugriva?

2565
03:35:56 --> 03:36:05
 And what will be the strength of Rama who killed Vali, the greatest monkey?

2566
03:36:05 --> 03:36:10
 Like that they will estimate and their courage will come down.

2567
03:36:10 --> 03:36:25
 Q. If the previous action was against the action of the previous action, would it be the action of the previous action?

2568
03:36:25 --> 03:36:29
 I think what Hrishikesh asked is already answered by Valmiki.

2569
03:36:29 --> 03:36:41
 Yes, yes. If nothing in favor of Rama is damaged, that action can be done.

2570
03:36:41 --> 03:36:46
 If that does not contradict Rama.

2571
03:36:46 --> 03:36:58
 But one place Hanuman, in this sloka, he uttered this sloka in a different context.

2572
03:36:58 --> 03:37:07
 That is, when he burned the Lanka, he thought, what foolish thing I did in these flames.

2573
03:37:07 --> 03:37:14
 Sita must have been burned. There he tells that sloka.

2574
03:37:14 --> 03:37:23
 A person must do an action, new action, which will not spoil the original action.

2575
03:37:23 --> 03:37:29
 But what I did, I burned the Lanka, I discouraged all the demons.

2576
03:37:29 --> 03:37:34
 That is also correct. Sita might have been burned in these flames.

2577
03:37:34 --> 03:37:38
 There he tells that sloka. Yes, in that context he tells that sloka.

2578
03:37:38 --> 03:37:43
 That was my next question, Swamy.

2579
03:37:43 --> 03:37:50
 Already it is written in Valmiki Ramayana. So, don't come.

2580
03:37:50 --> 03:37:56
 Sorry, one last question. Hanuman is considered to be the servant of Rama.

2581
03:37:56 --> 03:38:02
 Adi Shesha is considered to be the slave. So, what is the difference between servant and slave?

2582
03:38:02 --> 03:38:10
 No, Hanuman is also a slave. Dasa. Dasoham Kosalendra Rasa.

2583
03:38:10 --> 03:38:19
 Ramasya Krishnagarmana climbs the wall of Lanka and shouts,

2584
03:38:19 --> 03:38:26
 Jayat Chidibalu Rama Lachwanascha Mahabalaha. Raja Jayat Shibhuri Vuraghavir Naapipadita.

2585
03:38:26 --> 03:38:31
 Dasoham Kosalendra Rasa. I am the servant of Rama.

2586
03:38:31 --> 03:38:42
 Ramasya Krishnagarmana. He is also dasa. Dasa is also a stage of devotion.

2587
03:38:42 --> 03:38:51
 Rasa. No, Lachwana is also behaved like that. Dasya, Swamy.

2588
03:38:51 --> 03:38:59
 That is what Madhvacharya says.

2589
03:38:59 --> 03:39:07
 God is saviour and the devotee is the servant.

2590
03:39:07 --> 03:39:14
 That is the relationship between God and devotee. That is what is told by Madhvacharya.

2591
03:39:14 --> 03:39:20
 Seviya Sevaka Sammantha. Jeeve Svarayoh.

2592
03:39:20 --> 03:39:26
 Swamiji, how is that different from Shesha Shesha Sambandham, Swamiji?

2593
03:39:26 --> 03:39:32
 Shesha Shesha Sambandham is Ramanujam. That is with Lachwana.

2594
03:39:32 --> 03:39:38
 Dasya, the Seviya Sevaka Sammantha is with Hanuman. That is told by Madhvacharya.

2595
03:39:38 --> 03:39:44
 That is why in Madhva Matha Hanuman is very important. Not Lachwana.

2596
03:39:44 --> 03:39:50
 Lachwana is important in Ramanujamatha. In fact Ramanujamatha himself is called as Lachwana.

2597
03:39:50 --> 03:39:56
 He is Adi Shesha Avatara. Lachwana is also Adi Shesha Avatara.

2598
03:39:56 --> 03:40:04
 Shesha Shesha Sammantha means the part and whole.

2599
03:40:05 --> 03:40:11
 Sometimes we say, you both are my eyes.

2600
03:40:11 --> 03:40:17
 That is the Shesha Shesha Sammantha. Part and whole.

2601
03:40:17 --> 03:40:21
 That is introduced by Ramanujamatha.

2602
03:40:21 --> 03:40:27
 And the Seviya Sevaka Sammantha is introduced by Manvacharya.

2603
03:40:28 --> 03:40:32
 Anything more?

2604
03:40:39 --> 03:40:43
 If nothing is there, we will end this session.

2605
03:40:43 --> 03:40:45
 Swamiji, last question.

2606
03:40:45 --> 03:40:51
 For suppose Ravana, of course Ravana is a villain in that character Rama.

2607
03:40:52 --> 03:40:59
 For suppose Ravana, even entire Lanka was made of gold.

2608
03:40:59 --> 03:41:03
 With entire gold along with Sita surrendered to Lord Rama.

2609
03:41:03 --> 03:41:11
 He might have crossed even like Gopikas and Hanuman or not. Just a question.

2610
03:41:11 --> 03:41:27
 If Ravana had surrendered Sita to Lord Rama along with his Lanka, would he have become a devotee then?

2611
03:41:27 --> 03:41:31
 I don't understand. You tell me Prasad.

2612
03:41:31 --> 03:41:41
 If Ravana had surrendered Sita to Lord Rama along with his Lanka, would he have become a devotee then?

2613
03:41:41 --> 03:41:43
 What can I do?

2614
03:41:43 --> 03:41:51
 Whatever you ask a question, you ask a question about Ravana.

2615
03:41:51 --> 03:41:53
 I will give the answer.

2616
03:41:53 --> 03:42:01
 But every time Dick and Harry doing something, how can you ask question to me?

2617
03:42:01 --> 03:42:05
 I am not responsible for human beings.

2618
03:42:05 --> 03:42:08
 I am only responsible for God.

2619
03:42:08 --> 03:42:12
 God is not a human being.

2620
03:42:12 --> 03:42:16
 I am not responsible for human beings.

2621
03:42:16 --> 03:42:20
 I am only responsible for God.

2622
03:42:20 --> 03:42:26
 God in absolute state or God in human form state.

2623
03:42:26 --> 03:42:30
 Rama did like this, how? You question, I will ask. I will answer.

2624
03:42:30 --> 03:42:35
 Krishna did like this, how? You ask, I will answer.

2625
03:42:35 --> 03:42:41
 But Satyartha did like this, how? You cannot ask.

2626
03:42:41 --> 03:42:45
 How can I answer? How I am responsible for the human being?

2627
03:42:45 --> 03:42:47
 Ravana is a human being.

2628
03:42:47 --> 03:42:50
 Ravana is not God.

2629
03:42:50 --> 03:42:52
 Ravana is not God.

2630
03:42:52 --> 03:42:57
 I am standing on the side of God.

2631
03:42:57 --> 03:43:00
 Not on the side of souls.

2632
03:43:00 --> 03:43:04
 Souls do several things.

2633
03:43:04 --> 03:43:08
 That is as per their samskaras.

2634
03:43:08 --> 03:43:11
 As per their qualities.

2635
03:43:11 --> 03:43:16
 They have attained in the previous births.

2636
03:43:16 --> 03:43:18
 For that I am not...

2637
03:43:18 --> 03:43:27
 See, I have come, I am standing only to answer about God.

2638
03:43:27 --> 03:43:30
 Not about... You also asked once question.

2639
03:43:30 --> 03:43:39
 Why Shantanu did not object when Ganga is dipping the children in the Ganga?

2640
03:43:39 --> 03:43:41
 How I am responsible?

2641
03:43:41 --> 03:43:43
 Shantanu is not God.

2642
03:43:43 --> 03:43:46
 Ganga is not God.

2643
03:43:46 --> 03:43:49
 They both are souls.

2644
03:43:49 --> 03:43:58
 When souls did something, if you are there in their time, you put a case in the court.

2645
03:43:58 --> 03:44:00
 Then the court will punish them.

2646
03:44:00 --> 03:44:03
 Israel is fault.

2647
03:44:03 --> 03:44:05
 I am not responsible.

2648
03:44:05 --> 03:44:11
 I am responsible only for God.

2649
03:44:11 --> 03:44:15
 God in human form, God in energetic form.

2650
03:44:15 --> 03:44:17
 Their actions...

2651
03:44:17 --> 03:44:21
 Why Krishna danced with the Guru? Because you asked me.

2652
03:44:21 --> 03:44:24
 I will tell for one day.

2653
03:44:24 --> 03:44:28
 Because it is related to God.

2654
03:44:28 --> 03:44:38
 Swami, will God be pleased or not if he has done like that?

2655
03:44:38 --> 03:44:42
 God will be pleased or not if for suppose he has done like that?

2656
03:44:42 --> 03:44:49
 If God is pleased, he would have not killed Ravana.

2657
03:44:49 --> 03:44:51
 Rama killed Ravana.

2658
03:44:51 --> 03:44:53
 Is it not?

2659
03:44:53 --> 03:44:57
 That means God is not pleased.

2660
03:44:57 --> 03:45:08
 And to displease God by displeasing God, then only Ravana can become enemy to Rama.

2661
03:45:08 --> 03:45:13
 When he became enemy, he can get salvation in three births.

2662
03:45:13 --> 03:45:16
 Not as a devotee.

2663
03:45:17 --> 03:45:28
 If he behaves like a devotee, Ravana behaves, then he would have taken seven births to reach Vaikuntha.

2664
03:45:28 --> 03:45:32
 Definitely he behaved like enemy.

2665
03:45:32 --> 03:45:37
 That is why he reached God in three births.

2666
03:45:37 --> 03:45:40
 That itself gives the answer logic.

2667
03:45:40 --> 03:45:45
 That means if Rama is pleased, Ravana must be a devotee.

2668
03:45:45 --> 03:45:50
 Is it not? Ravana cannot be enemy.

2669
03:45:50 --> 03:45:58
 If Ravana is not pleased, then only Ravana can be enemy.

2670
03:45:58 --> 03:46:05
 As enemy only in three births he will reach. That is the boon, you know, Vara.

2671
03:46:05 --> 03:46:14
 That means Ravana behaved like enemy, must behave like enemy, according to the desire by Jaya and Vijaya.

2672
03:46:14 --> 03:46:18
 Since he behaved like enemy, Rama is not pleased.

2673
03:46:18 --> 03:46:21
 The answer lies there itself.

2674
03:46:21 --> 03:46:23
 Okay, Pramodji.

2675
03:46:23 --> 03:46:26
 Then the next program, Pramodji.

2676
03:46:26 --> 03:46:29
 Swami, I just got one doubt now, Swami.

2677
03:46:29 --> 03:46:32
 This is Veena Dutta.

2678
03:46:32 --> 03:46:39
 Swami, Jaya and Vijaya might have taken these seven births only, no, Swami.

2679
03:46:39 --> 03:46:42
 Then that time also they will be with Lord only as friend.

2680
03:46:42 --> 03:46:45
 It is the same Lord here and there also.

2681
03:46:45 --> 03:46:51
 No, suppose Jaya and Vijaya have taken seven births as devotees,

2682
03:46:51 --> 03:46:57
 then Jaya and Vijaya would have not behaved like Ravana and Kumbhakarna.

2683
03:46:57 --> 03:47:00
 Yes, Swami, that is correct.

2684
03:47:00 --> 03:47:03
 Yes.

2685
03:47:03 --> 03:47:06
 This is not related to the old question, Swami.

2686
03:47:06 --> 03:47:09
 Yes, Swami, that is correct.

2687
03:47:09 --> 03:47:12
 Yes.

2688
03:47:12 --> 03:47:15
 This is not related to the old question, Swami.

2689
03:47:15 --> 03:47:23
 But Jaya and Vijaya have chosen to reach Vaikuntha in three births only instead of taking seven births.

2690
03:47:23 --> 03:47:24
 Yes.

2691
03:47:24 --> 03:47:32
 But they could have also chosen seven births because they will be with the same Lord here also as friend.

2692
03:47:32 --> 03:47:46
 But Jaya and Vijaya have chosen three births and not seven births telling the reason that we cannot wait so long time separated from God.

2693
03:47:46 --> 03:47:51
 God also will be incarnated in those seven births also, no, Swami.

2694
03:47:51 --> 03:48:00
 God has chosen that option to become devotees in seven births.

2695
03:48:00 --> 03:48:03
 God would have agreed for that also. God gave two options.

2696
03:48:03 --> 03:48:05
 Okay, got it, Swami.

2697
03:48:05 --> 03:48:11
 Either in seven births as a devotee or in three births as enemy.

2698
03:48:11 --> 03:48:20
 Then Jaya and Vijaya told, we cannot wait such a long time seven births to reach our God.

2699
03:48:20 --> 03:48:28
 We will reach you in three births itself as enemies because the separation time is lesser.

2700
03:48:28 --> 03:48:31
 Got it, Swami.

2701
03:48:31 --> 03:48:37
 So they have chosen to be close in the form of Narayana only.

2702
03:48:37 --> 03:48:41
 To be close with Narayana early, as early as possible.

2703
03:48:41 --> 03:48:48
 And that is possible only when they become enemies in three births.

2704
03:48:48 --> 03:48:50
 Understood.

2705
03:48:50 --> 03:48:52
 Understood.

2706
03:48:58 --> 03:49:03
 Okay.
