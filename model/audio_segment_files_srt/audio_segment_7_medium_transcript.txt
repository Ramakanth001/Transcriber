They are looking as controversies to your eyes.. They are looking as different types of entertainments to my eyes.. See, entertainment also must be different types.. Same entertainment will also bore.. So, the original intention of creating this universe is only ekaki naramate, only for entertainment.. And the situations are developed in such a way that God is entertained.. But at the same time, if you do deep analysis, whatever God did is justice.. That is true.. But there is another statement.. If you do the deep analysis, whatever is justice, that alone is done by God.. Because of your petty mind, the inability of understanding of your mind, you are thinking it as injustice.. I will give an example.. One should not tell a lie.. Krishna told Dharmaraja to tell a lie that Ashwathama is killed, so that Drona will be killed.. By telling a lie, killing a guru like Drona is injustice.. That is the understanding of Dharmaraja.. He did not go more deep into the subject.. But the analysis of Krishna is, Drona is supporting Kavaravas.. Kavaravas are on the side of injustice.. And it is very difficult to kill Drona, as long as the bow is in his hand, bow and arrow.. In Ramavatar also, Vali could not be fought.. Because anybody who fights with Vali, half strength of the opponent fellow will join the strength of Vali.. And the strength of Vali is always greater than the strength of the opponent.. So nobody can defeat Vali.. But Vali is doing lot of injustice.. He should be killed.. Rama killed from behind the tree.. That is justified.. Hence justified means,. hence justified means,. this is the tear of Subhashchandra Bose.. In getting the freedom, he prepared army.. Let us fight with British people.. Hence justified means.. But Gandhi told, means justified hence.. That is the difference between both of them.. Both are correct.. Because if you take the case of Vali,. Rama killing Vali from behind the tree. is hence justified means.. Because Vali is unjust,. killing Vali is justice.. So killing him from behind the tree,. that is not injustice.. Killing a bad fellow through false means is justified.. There hence justified means.. Now means justified hence, what Gandhi told.. That is also correct in different context.. Suppose taking this example,. one fellow, such and such fellow is bad,. because he is my enemy.. He is not actually bad.. Because he is my enemy, he is bad.. So just like Rama killed Vali,. let me kill from his backside.. He may exploit.. Hence justified means.. In order to prevent it, means justified hence.. Okay, you think that he is bad,. then fight before him.. Why do you kill him from the backside?. If he fights with him before, he cannot defeat him.. So there means justified hence.. So that hence justified means is not exploited.. So you think that Krishna is wrong in saying to Dharmaraja. that he should tell a lie to kill Drona.. These things you take as contradictions.. Of Dharma.. It is not a contradiction of Dharma, it is Dharma.. Not because God has done, it is Dharma.. Even by analysis it is Dharma.. He is supporting Kauravas.. And unless he is killed, Kauravas cannot be killed.. If Kauravas are not killed, injustice is not destroyed.. Pandavas will not win, justice cannot be established.. So what you feel as atrocity,. that is correct even on analysis.. Because you are unable to analyze,. you are talking as atrocities of the previous incarnations.. Previous incarnations mean same God as the previous incarnations.. You are criticizing the present God also about the past incarnations.. Past incarnations are only dresses.. The present incarnation is the person.. You are criticizing the bearer of the shirt, not the shirt.. So it is due to lack of the depth of your analysis,. they appear as atrocities.. How do you support those previous atrocities?. You are putting first.. They are not atrocities at all.. They appeared as atrocities because of the lack of your intelligence,. the lack of your analysis, the lack of your deep analysis.. Followed?. Yes.. Thank you Swami.. Swami, I have a question completely related to pravritti.. All householders often follow traditions of the society,. thinking that that is only justice.. They are expected to give money or varti gifts at marriages and other functions of the family.. Those families already have enough wealth.. Even a family member with low income is bound to give costly gifts,. otherwise prestige is lost.. Even if good clothes or jewelry are not worn, people do bad comments and upset us.. So people are running after money to stand along with their peers in the society.. Now how to divert the time and effort to God in this societal pressure of earning money?. Sometimes in the present invitation cards, no gifts are accepted.. They are putting no gifts.. No gifts are accepted.. Nobody is there putting gifts.. See, the thing is everything is business.. Pravritti is only business.. You are going to the marriage function.. You are taking meals.. What is the cost of that meals?. 100 rupees.. Or if you go to a hotel, some 200, 300 it may take.. You 300 cash and come back.. He will come to your function.. He will also take meals and you.. Of course, you must compare how many items you have eaten there. and how many items you have prepared here.. There should be justice.. It is all business only.. It is not love, real love.. Real love lies when you are in love.. When you present something without any expectation in return.. If you give anything to me, nothing will be returned back.. If you have true love, I am the best person for true love. because nothing will be returned back.. The true love also will come out.. Its reality will come out.. We all love you, Swami.. I am telling you just an example.. Without aspiring anything in return, you must present that it is true love.. But you give a silver tumbler.. They give you a silver plate.. You compare.. Our tumbler is bigger.. This plate is smaller.. What is the use of such a gift?. It is all pure business.. Nothing else.. Only before God, the real devotion comes.. There is no devotion between the human beings.. There is no real love between the human beings.. The real love becomes, the word real love becomes meaningful only in the context of God.. Not in the context of pravrti.. Only in nivrti it is correct.. Because in Yajnavalkya says,. Yajnavalkya in Veda says that the loves of all these worldly bonds are false.. They are not true.. A husband loves wife because she is giving happiness to him.. A wife loves the husband because he is giving happiness to her.. Atmanakkamaya sarvampriyambhavati,. ari pachyurva.. Whatever I told is told in Veda.. So all the worldly loves are fraud.. But God loves the devotee because he loves somebody who is giving happiness to him.. But if you take God as a devotee,. God loves the devotee,. but God doesn't expect any happiness from the devotee.. He is already full of happiness.. He is full of bliss.. What kind of happiness he requires from a devotee?. That he is devotion of bliss.. The devotee will get happiness from the God,. but God need not get any happiness from any devotee, any human being, any soul.. And when God loves the devotee, that is true love.. Because there is no expectation of any happiness in return.. But what devotee by worshipping God, he expects some happiness from God through some boon.. So only in the nivruthi, in the context of God and devotee,. you will find true love, that too from the side of God only.. When a person is in love with God,. when a person is loving you without aspiring anything from you,. should you not behave in the same way towards the other person also?. Is it not justified?. Then why you aspire from God?. Show me any person who is not aspiring from God.. Everybody is aspiring.. If you put one coconut, if you break one coconut, he aspires something.. That water has gone on the floor.. Those two halves have gone into your idli chutney.. In fact, nothing you have done to God.. Where is the scope for you to aspire from God?. What you have given to God?. That sound of breaking the coconut, which is also not sweet, which is very harsh.. That sound of breaking the coconut, which is also not sweet, which is very harsh.. We have no right to aspire anything from God.. And because he loves truly us, we must sacrifice to God.. You must reward the true love.. You are rewarding false love in the world.. You are not rewarding the true love of God.. What?. Is it not?. One husband took bath in the tank and came inside the house. and lied on the floor, acted like as if he is dead.. The wife, you know, he did not rise.. So I weep now, all the people will come.. But inside the kitchen, just now the cooking is over.. Some curry and some tomato sambar already prepared.. She closed the doors, went inside the kitchen, ate all those.. Then washed, wiped her mouth.. Then opened the doors and started weeping.. All the relatives, neighbors thinking.. She is weeping.. For you, I have prepared all the items in the kitchen.. Without you, you think you have gone.. Then the husband stood and started weeping.. Then the husband stood.. Just now you have eaten.. In Coimbatore, I have said, when somebody dies in the house,. people will be weeping.. And the relatives, friends, etc., they come and sit.. They also start weeping, joining with them.. So many people will be weeping.. I was also there.. One lady is asking, the side lady, is anything prepared or not?. When the other lady told,. Upma is prepared.. Then she started weeping.. Actually I have seen.. I have seen this.. So, is it over?. Any more questions?. Actually our time is half an hour.. Yes, Swami. It is already half an hour.. We are at 6 o'clock.. Yes, but still if any question is there, I don't mind to answer.. Okay, Swami.. So, Swami, when Pandavas won the war, they got.... One thing.. You put one year only, that gold.. Or both years.. One.. N.T. Ramarov did like that to become Chief Minister.. So our next Chief Minister.... I will be very attentive to answer your question.. Tell me.. Tell me.. Swami, when Pandavas won the war,. with the help of Lord Krishna,. Lord Krishna, after helping them,. he went to his kingdom.. He did not aspire for a single penny.. And it is told that when. money ends through Adharma,. we should not enjoy it.. And instead of that, we should give that wealth. to the welfare of the society.. Swami ji, here one context is that. even Arjuna fought for his righteous share.. Suppose in this Kali Yuga,. if a person ends in justified means of 100 rupees,. at least one month,. he should not enjoy it.. And if he does not enjoy it,. he should not enjoy it.. So, when he is in the state of. end of in justified means of 100 rupees,. at least one paisa, ten paisa will be there. and injustice.. In that case,. only. by increasing devotion. and knowledge,. we can give that money. to human incarnation of. God.. We can.... So, in that case,. that money will not be. useful, no, Swami ji, because anyhow. in Kali Yuga,. the money, if we give to our. like children. and all issues, anyhow. it is going to. waste our. like. that is going to be. unjust to them, right?. That is,. human incarnation,. as he is an Agni,. he is a truth. and he is human incarnation,. so,. we should give it to him.. We should give it. and all are no questions.. See, here,. God Krishna. took the. Mahabharata war. as his work.. That is, to establish. justice. and to destroy injustice.. And his work. was assisted by Pandavas.. He should pay to. Pandavas.. Not Pandavas give to Krishna.. Krishna should give to Pandavas.. Because what he tells,. this is my work.. First, Arjuna thinks. that he is fighting. for his selfish purpose,. to earn his. justified share.. I don't want that share.. I cannot kill my grandfather.. That was his argument.. Then how Krishna. turned on that concept?. He told,. you fellow, this is not your work.. Even if you go out of the war,. I will kill them.. Even if you are not fighting,. I am going to kill them.. Already I have killed them.. You kill. the already killed persons.. I have killed them.. Whose work?. Dharma samsthapan arthaya. sambhavami yuge yuge. This is not my. new work.. In every yuga,. I. incarnated myself. to destroy injustice.. Similarly, on the same work,. I am incarnated now.. I am doing my work.. You are not killing them.. I am killing them.. I am doing my own work.. You just assist me,. appear as if you have assisted me. and get the fee.. Already I have killed them.. They are unjust people.. So,. you participate. in my work,. being my devotee.. In that case,. God is greater. than your grandfather.. You must be prepared to kill. the grandfather for the sake of God.. Don't kill your grandfather. for your sake.. To get the right share. of the property,. then Arjuna is killing. grandfather for his share,. for his work.. Now,. I am destroying injustice.. Bhishma is supporting unjust. kauravas.. You kill. your grandfather. for my sake. I am greater than your grandfather.. That is how he turned the entire. angle of Mahabharata war.. Then Arjuna. killed Bhishma,. killed Drona,. the teacher.. The grandfather and the teacher. are not greater. than God Krishna.. Now, this war. is my work.. You are assisting. me in my work.. Not your work.. Since it is my work,. you will not get anything.. If you are killing Bhishma. for this, earning your. share of the kingdom. for the sake of money, property. means money, then it is. a sin.. For your selfishness,. you have killed the grandfather.. But now,. I am going to kill. kauravas because they are. on the side of. injustice.. This is my work.. You are helping me. as my servant, as my. devotee.. And when you are helping God. as a devotee. or as a servant, grandfather. and teacher are not greater than God.. You can kill them.. You killed them.. That is how Krishna. turned the angle.. The angle of Arjuna. was completely turned.. And when Sanjaya told. Dhritarashtra about. all this Bhagavad Gita,. Dhritarashtra scolds Krishna,. that fellow is responsible.. If that fellow is not there,. Arjuna would have not fought.. Then the kingdom. must have come to my son.. That fellow is. the real problem.. Did you follow. what I told?. Swamiji, in every context. you are telling that intention,. intention, every fruit. depends on the intention.. You see, I am telling in this present. context, it is the intention. only that decides the sin,. the fruit,. whether it is sin. or merit.. If your intention is to serve. God Krishna. in his work, then. the fruit is punyam.. If your intention. is to earn your property share. even by killing grandfather,. that is sin, that is papa.. Here also,. the intention decides. the fruit.. If you are fighting. with the intention. of getting your share. by killing. Bhishma,. are you following?. Then. you know, then. the fruit is sin.. If you are killing Bhishma. with an intention. to help. God Krishna in his work. as his devotee,. as his servant,.
