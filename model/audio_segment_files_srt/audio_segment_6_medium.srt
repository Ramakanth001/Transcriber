1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
 brain is if we give meals to him today, what is its cost?

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:15
 Only that will be, that will enter into the brain.

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
 So anyway, they are also my children only.

4
00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
 I must give more attention for them.

5
00:00:26 --> 00:00:37
 That is why I have published so many books in Telugu.

6
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
 So okay.

7
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
 Yes Swami.

8
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
 Swami, next question Swami.

9
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
 This question is from Miss Bhargavi.

10
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
 Namaskaram Swami.

11
00:00:52 --> 00:01:01
 Whenever I say something related to human incarnations, my friends usually don't trust.

12
00:01:01 --> 00:01:10
 Some even ask why you even believe these incarnations when we already have so many gods.

13
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
 I am not good at explaining the importance of human incarnations.

14
00:01:16 --> 00:01:23
 I am afraid they might make fun of human incarnations which is a sin.

15
00:01:23 --> 00:01:29
 I know you understand my situation as you are Sarvajna.

16
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
 What should I do Swami?

17
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
 See you simply put one question to them.

18
00:01:35 --> 00:01:43
 Who is the greatest devotee of God in this creation so far?

19
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
 Hanuman and Radha.

20
00:01:46 --> 00:01:52
 Hanuman has gone to Brahma Loka, Satchaloka.

21
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
 Radha has gone to Goloka.

22
00:01:55 --> 00:02:04
 Is there a greater devotee than Hanuman and Radha you ask?

23
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
 See you at least examine the fruits they got.

24
00:02:09 --> 00:02:14
 Brahma Loka is the ultimate loka of world of God.

25
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
 That is ultimate abode of God.

26
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
 Goloka is higher than Brahma Loka, higher than the abode of God.

27
00:02:23 --> 00:02:28
 Who reached these two highest fruits?

28
00:02:28 --> 00:02:33
 Hanuman and Radha.

29
00:02:33 --> 00:02:40
 Hanuman and Radha both worshipped contemporary human incarnations.

30
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
 Not even past human incarnations.

31
00:02:43 --> 00:02:48
 We worshipped Rama and Krishna, past human incarnations.

32
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
 But we don't worship contemporary human incarnations.

33
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
 Hanuman and Radha are not like that.

34
00:02:53 --> 00:02:58
 Hanuman did not worship Vamana and Narasimha, past human incarnations.

35
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
 Hanuman worshipped Rama, his contemporary human incarnations.

36
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
 Krishna, Gokas did not worship Rama.

37
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
 They worshipped Krishna, the contemporary human incarnations.

38
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
 And both Hanuman and Gokas got the highest fruit.

39
00:03:17 --> 00:03:25
 What more logic is needed if he doesn't understand this much?

40
00:03:25 --> 00:03:30
 He doesn't have brain in his head.

41
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
 No brain in his head.

42
00:03:35 --> 00:03:40
 And such fellow, you cannot do anything.

43
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
 See there is a shloka.

44
00:03:49 --> 00:03:54
 In a village, everywhere municipal water taps are there.

45
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
 Very good water is coming.

46
00:03:57 --> 00:04:04
 One fellow in his house, one well is there.

47
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
 That well is full of salt water.

48
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
 But that fellow drinks only that water,

49
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
 telling, my father dug this well.

50
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
 Since my father dug this well,

51
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
 I will drink water only from that,

52
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
 even if it is saltiest and hardest water.

53
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
 I will not drink soft water.

54
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
 What can you do with that fellow?

55
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
 Just leave him.

56
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
 For that person, this much logic is sufficient.

57
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
 Do you agree Rama and Krishna are Gods?

58
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
 Definitely.

59
00:04:51 --> 00:04:56
 Do you agree that Ramayanam and Bhagavatam are the highest epics?

60
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
 Yes, they are highest epics.

61
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
 Do you agree that Hanuman and Radha are the highest epics?

62
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
 Do you agree that Hanuman and Radha

63
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
 worshipped only contemporary human incarnations?

64
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
 They never worshipped energetic incarnations.

65
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
 Nor they worshipped past human incarnations.

66
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
 They worshipped only contemporary human incarnations.

67
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
 And they got highest fruits.

68
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
 Nobody got any fruit equal to them.

69
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
 Sufficient, there is no need of further.

70
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
 These four or five sentences are sufficient.

71
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
 If he has got some gujju,

72
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
 grain in his head,

73
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
 he will follow.

74
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
 Swami, doubt.

75
00:05:50 --> 00:05:51
 Yes.

76
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
 As a part of propagation of the divine knowledge,

77
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
 we are meeting with many people like this

78
00:05:58 --> 00:06:03
 and we are also posting your discourses, cut, paste,

79
00:06:03 --> 00:06:04
 in that manner.

80
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
 Sometimes we are discussing like that the process is going on.

81
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
 But in spite of listening and reading all those things,

82
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
 the people are very rigid,

83
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
 that ignoring, not accepting, not rejecting,

84
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
 just ignoring and want to continue chatting with me.

85
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
 That is how can I deal with them?

86
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
 Shall I continue propagation?

87
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
 See, you continue your propagation,

88
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
 it will take time to get the result.

89
00:06:33 --> 00:06:39
 The initial stage itself, excellent results will not come.

90
00:06:39 --> 00:06:47
 One lady was advised to do pradashnams to people three

91
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
 to get issues.

92
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
 One round she does and she is so happy.

93
00:06:59 --> 00:07:03
 Rather pregnant she has to do pradashnams.

94
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
 It will take time.

95
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
 Some time it will take.

96
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
 Definitely one day,

97
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
 definitely one day,

98
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
 Narshtar Damas told,

99
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
 one day all religions will disappear.

100
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
 Only one religion will remain in this entire world.

101
00:07:30 --> 00:07:37
 One fellow will come from a country surrounded by three seas.

102
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
 He is not only a Sanskrit scholar,

103
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
 but also a scientist.

104
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
 These are written by Narshtar Damas.

105
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
 All religions will disappear

106
00:07:48 --> 00:07:53
 and only the Vedic religion established by him will remain.

107
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
 And in the entire universe,

108
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
 Thursday will become holiday.

109
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
 That is, Gaurdharta's day.

110
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
 So it is going to happen.

111
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
 One day, myself and Pani went to,

112
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
 we were talking with Koneer Sachinarayanan,

113
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
 chairman of KL University.

114
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
 He was telling,

115
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
 backside there was a big Hanuman's photo

116
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
 and he was telling,

117
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
 human incarnation is so much valid like that.

118
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
 Then I told,

119
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
 sir, I worked there,

120
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
 sir, backside of you,

121
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
 big photo of Hanuman is there,

122
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
 whom he worshipped.

123
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
 He was stunned.

124
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
 Then he told,

125
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
 Swami, one day,

126
00:08:55 --> 00:09:02
 your knowledge will drown the entire world like tsunami.

127
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
 He was also there.

128
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
 So,

129
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
 one day the result will come.

130
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
 Let the pradakshams be completed.

131
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
 Let her become pregnant.

132
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
 Yes.

133
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
 Next.

134
00:09:28 --> 00:09:33
 Swami, next question is from Ms. Snehita.

135
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
 Swami, if all human forms of God,

136
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
 like Dutta, Satya Sai Baba, Jesus, Allah, etc.

137
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
 and all of them commonly preach,

138
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
 God is one,

139
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
 then why do we have so many religions?

140
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
 You see,

141
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
 the internal God is only one.

142
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
 But the external dresses are different.

143
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
 Suppose in a cloth shop,

144
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
 are they not keeping different dresses?

145
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
 Only one person is going to wear all the dresses.

146
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
 So,

147
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
 these external forms

148
00:10:25 --> 00:10:30
 are chosen by devotees as per their tastes.

149
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
 Somebody likes Hanuman,

150
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
 somebody likes Rama,

151
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
 somebody likes Krishna,

152
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
 somebody likes Dutta.

153
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
 The dresses have different colours.

154
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
 Similarly, the external forms

155
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
 have different qualities.

156
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
 The entire humanity,

157
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
 each human being is having a specific quality,

158
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
 liking for a specific quality.

159
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
 As per his liking or her liking,

160
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
 the dress can be selected.

161
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
 The person wearing that dress,

162
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
 all dresses are one and the same.

163
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
 But the dress is not the same.

164
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
 All dresses are one and the same.

165
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
 But there is fascination for dress

166
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
 apart from the fascination to the person.

167
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
 Even though the wife is fascinated

168
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
 to the husband,

169
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
 she says,

170
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
 you wear this dress,

171
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
 this dress will be good for you.

172
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
 No, no, no, don't come in this dress.

173
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
 This is not happening.

174
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
 So, different devotees have fascinations

175
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
 for different qualities,

176
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
 different behaviours,

177
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
 different personalities.

178
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
 So, in order to be available

179
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
 for every human being of humanity,

180
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
 the same God is wearing different dresses

181
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
 and since he has the maya power,

182
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
 he is becoming also a several persons

183
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
 wearing different clothes.

184
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
 Now you choose,

185
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
 if you like the personality,

186
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
 you choose that personality.

187
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
 If you like the dress,

188
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
 you choose that person wearing dress.

189
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
 To cater the likings of all the devotees,

190
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
 God has become several.

191
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
 Ekaṁ santviprāṁ bhūdhā vadhan.

192
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
 So that is for the facility of the devotees.

193
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
 The Hinduism

194
00:12:56 --> 00:13:01
 is the best example

195
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
 which looks to cater the likings

196
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
 of all the devotees.

197
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
 It suits God as per your liking.

198
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
 It doesn't force your liking to the God.

199
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
 Because in devotion,

200
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
 force should not be there.

201
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
 Full freedom must be there.

202
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
 So, the whole body should be there.

203
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
 Full freedom must be there.

204
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
 Truth always shines in freedom,

205
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
 not in force.

206
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
 Okay?

207
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
 Yes, Swami.

208
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
 One more question is there, shall I ask Swami?

209
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
 Okay, Swami.

210
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
 This question is from Mrs. Suganya Raman.

211
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
 Pāda namaskar, Swamiji.

212
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
 In Viṣṇu Sahasranāmam,

213
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
 there is a verse when Parvati Devi

214
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
 asked about how scholars can chant

215
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
 the whole Nāmāvalī without fail.

216
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
 Īśvara answers,

217
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
 Śrī Rāma Rāma Rāmeti,

218
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
 mentioning that the name Rāma

219
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
 is equivalent to thousand names of Viṣṇu

220
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
 and it can be chanted.

221
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
 My question is,

222
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
 when Lord Kṛṣṇa was there at that time

223
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
 as contemporary human incarnation

224
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
 when Viṣṇu Sahasranāmā was given,

225
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
 why the previous or past incarnation

226
00:14:55 --> 00:14:59
 Lord Rāma was mentioned by Īśvara

227
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
 at your lotus feet,

228
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
 your servant Suganya Rāma?

229
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
 Yes.

230
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
 Here,

231
00:15:09 --> 00:15:14
 when Īśvara said Śrī Rāma Rāma Rāmeti,

232
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
 he told,

233
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
 God Śiva told,

234
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
 the name of Rāma

235
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
 not in the view of

236
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
 the son of Dasaratha,

237
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
 he told,

238
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
 he took the word Rāma

239
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
 in its real sense.

240
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
 What is the meaning of Rāma?

241
00:15:49 --> 00:15:51
 Rāmate iti Rāma,

242
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
 Rāmayati iti Rāma.

243
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
 He who

244
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
 entertains himself is Rāma.

245
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
 He who entertains others is Rāma.

246
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
 These are the meanings of the word Rāma, word.

247
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
 That indicates the root God and the root story.

248
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
 Why all this creation came?

249
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
 Only for entertainment.

250
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
 Not only his self-entertainment,

251
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
 he created such a source

252
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
 in order to entertain them also

253
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
 he created the world.

254
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
 To pacify his hunger

255
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
 and to pacify the hunger of the family members.

256
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
 So the word Rāma there denotes

257
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
 the root sense of the God.

258
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
 Why God created this world

259
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
 and making all this confusion and all this?

260
00:17:01 --> 00:17:06
 For that the word Rāma answers.

261
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
 Rāma means

262
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
 he who entertains himself

263
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
 Rāmate iti Rāma,

264
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
 Rāmayati bhaktan swajana iti Rāma.

265
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
 He who entertains his devotees

266
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
 is Rāma.

267
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
 In that sense

268
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
 when God is taken

269
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
 all the other thousand names of Vishnu, God

270
00:17:38 --> 00:17:43
 mean different activities of God.

271
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
 And what is the source of all those

272
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
 thousand different activities of God?

273
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
 This entertainment only.

274
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
 Entertainment is the root

275
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
 for all the actions of God.

276
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
 There is no other purpose

277
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
 of any action of God

278
00:18:08 --> 00:18:10
 except entertainment.

279
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
 We do several activities

280
00:18:13 --> 00:18:15
 one activity to do job

281
00:18:15 --> 00:18:17
 and to fill our stomach

282
00:18:18 --> 00:18:20
 different purposes

283
00:18:20 --> 00:18:21
 but for God

284
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
 any activity of God

285
00:18:24 --> 00:18:26
 has only one purpose

286
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
 that is to entertain.

287
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
 To entertain himself

288
00:18:32 --> 00:18:34
 and to entertain his devotees

289
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
 also simultaneously.

290
00:18:37 --> 00:18:39
 Devotees are also entertained.

291
00:18:42 --> 00:18:45
 So that is the root

292
00:18:45 --> 00:18:47
 the root essence of

293
00:18:48 --> 00:18:51
 the all the activities of God

294
00:18:52 --> 00:18:54
 all the activities means

295
00:18:54 --> 00:18:56
 all the names of God.

296
00:18:57 --> 00:19:00
 So the root essence of all the names of God

297
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
 must be Rāma only.

298
00:19:04 --> 00:19:07
 There even Kṛṣṇa doing

299
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
 any activity contemporary

300
00:19:10 --> 00:19:12
 is only Rāma.

301
00:19:12 --> 00:19:15
 In fact than Rāma

302
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
 Kṛṣṇa is more entertained

303
00:19:19 --> 00:19:21
 by his so many lilas.

304
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
 So the son of Dasaratha

305
00:19:27 --> 00:19:29
 Rāma is not actual Rāma

306
00:19:29 --> 00:19:31
 Kṛṣṇa is Rāma

307
00:19:31 --> 00:19:33
 actual Rāma.

308
00:19:34 --> 00:19:36
 You know the meaning of the word Rāma

309
00:19:37 --> 00:19:39
 you will find that is why

310
00:19:39 --> 00:19:41
 God Śiva told

311
00:19:41 --> 00:19:43
 that sentence.

312
00:19:44 --> 00:19:45
 Okay?

313
00:19:47 --> 00:19:49
 Yes Swami

314
00:19:53 --> 00:19:55
 In Bhakti Sāhitya also

315
00:19:55 --> 00:19:57
 many of the gurus

316
00:19:57 --> 00:19:58
 worldly gurus

317
00:19:58 --> 00:20:00
 took Rāma Shabda

318
00:20:00 --> 00:20:03
 as a substitute for God

319
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
 not for Dasaratha Putra Rāma

320
00:20:05 --> 00:20:07
 like Kabirdas

321
00:20:07 --> 00:20:09
 and all other Jnana Shri Ishaaka devotee

322
00:20:09 --> 00:20:11
 right Kabir

323
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
 The Tharaka Mantra is Rāma

324
00:20:16 --> 00:20:18
 Tharaka Mantra they say

325
00:20:18 --> 00:20:20
 Tharaka Mantram

326
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
 Kūrīna durake nu

327
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
 Tūnyudanai tīni

328
00:20:24 --> 00:20:26
 Kūrannā

329
00:20:27 --> 00:20:28
 Tharaka Mantram

330
00:20:28 --> 00:20:30
 Tharaka Mantram means

331
00:20:30 --> 00:20:32
 that which

332
00:20:32 --> 00:20:34
 makes you to cross this world

333
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
 this

334
00:20:36 --> 00:20:38
 pain suffering of the world

335
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
 that is

336
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
 if you take that

337
00:20:43 --> 00:20:45
 essence of Rāma in you also

338
00:20:46 --> 00:20:48
 suppose you feel everything as

339
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
 entertainment

340
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
 no pain

341
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
 no suffering

342
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
 let anything happen

343
00:20:56 --> 00:20:58
 entertain

344
00:20:58 --> 00:21:00
 yourself

345
00:21:00 --> 00:21:02
 where is the sorrow?

346
00:21:02 --> 00:21:04
 See world is going

347
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
 on its own lines

348
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
 by

349
00:21:08 --> 00:21:10
 paining yourself by suffering

350
00:21:10 --> 00:21:12
 that is not going to change

351
00:21:12 --> 00:21:14
 instead of

352
00:21:14 --> 00:21:16
 paining

353
00:21:16 --> 00:21:18
 if you entertain

354
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
 the world will go anyway

355
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
 constantly like that only

356
00:21:22 --> 00:21:24
 you are

357
00:21:24 --> 00:21:26
 relieved from sorrow and pain

358
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
 that is called

359
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
 Moksha

360
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
 that is the liberation

361
00:21:32 --> 00:21:34
 what is liberation? Liberation from sorrow

362
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
 liberation from suffering

363
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
 liberation from pain

364
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
 everything

365
00:21:44 --> 00:21:46
 is according to you

366
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
 the

367
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
 deeds, your deeds

368
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
 every suffering is according

369
00:21:54 --> 00:21:56
 to your deeds

370
00:21:58 --> 00:22:00
 they are inevitable

371
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
 when they are inevitable enjoy

372
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
 there is a saying

373
00:22:08 --> 00:22:10
 when great is inevitable enjoy it

374
00:22:14 --> 00:22:16
 when the karma phalas

375
00:22:16 --> 00:22:18
 when the

376
00:22:18 --> 00:22:20
 fruits of the deeds done in the past

377
00:22:20 --> 00:22:22
 either in the past life

378
00:22:22 --> 00:22:24
 or in the past births

379
00:22:24 --> 00:22:26
 you have to undergo the

380
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
 fruits

381
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
 whether good fruits or bad fruits

382
00:22:30 --> 00:22:32
 they are inevitable

383
00:22:34 --> 00:22:36
 when they are inevitable why do you suffer?

384
00:22:36 --> 00:22:38
 you enjoy

385
00:22:40 --> 00:22:42
 by suffering

386
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
 yourself by getting

387
00:22:44 --> 00:22:46
 pain they are not going to be

388
00:22:46 --> 00:22:48
 avoided

389
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
 they are inevitable

390
00:22:50 --> 00:22:52
 that is what is

391
00:22:52 --> 00:22:54
 called as Nithyanandaha

392
00:22:56 --> 00:22:58
 always blissful

393
00:22:58 --> 00:23:00
 Akhanda Satchidananda Surupa

394
00:23:02 --> 00:23:04
 the ananda the bliss

395
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
 what is the

396
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
 difference between happiness and

397
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
 bliss you know?

398
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
 some people think

399
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
 bliss is very large

400
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
 thing

401
00:23:16 --> 00:23:18
 happiness is small thing

402
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
 that is what they think

403
00:23:22 --> 00:23:24
 that is not correct

404
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
 Anandaha means

405
00:23:26 --> 00:23:28
 the upasarga

406
00:23:28 --> 00:23:30
 samantatandatiti anandaha

407
00:23:32 --> 00:23:34
 that is continuously happiness is

408
00:23:34 --> 00:23:36
 bliss

409
00:23:38 --> 00:23:40
 happiness is 10 units

410
00:23:40 --> 00:23:42
 bliss is 1000 units

411
00:23:42 --> 00:23:44
 it is wrong

412
00:23:46 --> 00:23:48
 what is bliss? what is ananda?

413
00:23:48 --> 00:23:50
 a samantat

414
00:23:50 --> 00:23:52
 continuously

415
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
 nandati happy is

416
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56
 ananda

417
00:23:58 --> 00:24:00
 you should not have a break in the happiness

418
00:24:02 --> 00:24:04
 you should be continuously happy

419
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
 when it will happen?

420
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
 when you are

421
00:24:12 --> 00:24:14
 not attached to the fruits

422
00:24:14 --> 00:24:16
 of the deeds

423
00:24:16 --> 00:24:18
 and you are continuously happy

424
00:24:18 --> 00:24:20
 that is ananda

425
00:24:20 --> 00:24:22
 that is bliss

426
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
 it is not in the quantity of happiness

427
00:24:26 --> 00:24:28
 it is the continuity of happiness

428
00:24:28 --> 00:24:30
 I have told this

429
00:24:30 --> 00:24:32
 in jnana also

430
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
 so that continuous happiness is bliss

431
00:24:36 --> 00:24:38
 ananda

432
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
 a samantat means kala vachaka

433
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
 that relates to time

434
00:24:42 --> 00:24:44
 not parimana

435
00:24:44 --> 00:24:46
 not the quantity

436
00:24:48 --> 00:24:50
 because happiness

437
00:24:50 --> 00:24:52
 if it grows in its intensity

438
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
 quantity the fellow will die

439
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
 every human being

440
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
 cannot enjoy happiness

441
00:25:00 --> 00:25:02
 beyond certain limits

442
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
 100 units have happiness

443
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
 anybody can withstand

444
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
 if it crosses more than 100 units

445
00:25:12 --> 00:25:14
 the heart will stop and he will die

446
00:25:14 --> 00:25:16
 so that quantity has limitation

447
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
 so ananda does not mean

448
00:25:22 --> 00:25:24
 the increased happiness

449
00:25:24 --> 00:25:26
 increased happiness means

450
00:25:26 --> 00:25:28
 he will go up

451
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
 it is not increased

452
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
 a samantat nandati

453
00:25:32 --> 00:25:34
 a samantat means always

454
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
 always happy

455
00:25:38 --> 00:25:40
 not more

456
00:25:40 --> 00:25:42
 more than that

457
00:25:42 --> 00:25:44
 not more

458
00:25:44 --> 00:25:46
 I am happy more than all of you

459
00:25:50 --> 00:25:52
 that is not the meaning

460
00:25:52 --> 00:25:54
 continuous happiness

461
00:25:54 --> 00:25:56
 never you feel sorrow

462
00:25:56 --> 00:25:58
 or anything

463
00:26:00 --> 00:26:02
 let anything happen

464
00:26:02 --> 00:26:04
 you must have heard this story

465
00:26:04 --> 00:26:06
 one minister

466
00:26:06 --> 00:26:08
 anything happens

467
00:26:08 --> 00:26:10
 he was telling

468
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
 everything is good

469
00:26:12 --> 00:26:14
 everything is good for us

470
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
 then one day the king's finger was cut

471
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
 he told the minister

472
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
 everything is good for us

473
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
 then the king became angry

474
00:26:24 --> 00:26:26
 and put him in the prison

475
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
 then he went to

476
00:26:30 --> 00:26:32
 forest for hunting

477
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
 then he was caught by some

478
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
 forest fellows

479
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
 they want to give him sacrifice to

480
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
 Kali

481
00:26:42 --> 00:26:44
 they took him the king there

482
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46
 then the guru there observed

483
00:26:46 --> 00:26:48
 his finger is not there

484
00:26:50 --> 00:26:52
 anybody given as bali to Kali

485
00:26:52 --> 00:26:54
 must have all parts of the body

486
00:26:54 --> 00:26:56
 since he is not

487
00:26:56 --> 00:26:58
 having the finger they left him

488
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
 he returned back

489
00:27:02 --> 00:27:04
 released the minister

490
00:27:04 --> 00:27:06
 fell on his feet

491
00:27:06 --> 00:27:08
 what you told is correct

492
00:27:22 --> 00:27:24
 when Sita was

493
00:27:24 --> 00:27:26
 stolen by Ravana

494
00:27:28 --> 00:27:30
 Rama was weeping like anything

495
00:27:30 --> 00:27:32
 then

496
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
 he was going to

497
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
 ashram

498
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
 one sage asked

499
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
 your god Narayana

500
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
 why you are weeping

501
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
 he told

502
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
 Rama means Ramatriya Rama

503
00:27:48 --> 00:27:50
 he who is entertained is Rama

504
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
 I am entertained in my weeping

505
00:27:52 --> 00:27:54
 because you see

506
00:27:54 --> 00:27:56
 when you eat haunt dishes

507
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
 then also you are entertained

508
00:27:58 --> 00:28:00
 not only sweet dishes

509
00:28:02 --> 00:28:04
 I am entertained in the weeping

510
00:28:04 --> 00:28:06
 who said that I am unhappy

511
00:28:06 --> 00:28:08
 I am entertained in the weeping

512
00:28:08 --> 00:28:10
 who said that I am unhappy

513
00:28:30 --> 00:28:32
 who is my incarnation

514
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
 he who is happy

515
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 always

516
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
 without a trace of

517
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
 pain, suffering, sorrow

518
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
 he is my incarnation

519
00:28:44 --> 00:28:46
 he is my real incarnation

520
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
 bhakti ganga

521
00:28:56 --> 00:28:58
 my true vichanam na sachya gunam

522
00:28:58 --> 00:29:00
 vichanam na sachya gunam

523
00:29:00 --> 00:29:02
 vichanam na sachya gunam

524
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
 adhigala jivude

525
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
 navataram

526
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
 my true

527
00:29:08 --> 00:29:10
 identity

528
00:29:16 --> 00:29:18
 how much time is it

529
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
 6.30

530
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
 coffee is

531
00:29:26 --> 00:29:28
 green tea

532
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
 Swami

533
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
 one question

534
00:29:36 --> 00:29:38
 is there Swami

535
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
 this question is

536
00:29:40 --> 00:29:42
 from Sai Sri Nivas

537
00:29:42 --> 00:29:44
 from Mumbai

538
00:29:44 --> 00:29:46
 Padanamaskaram Swami

539
00:29:46 --> 00:29:48
 how can we encounter

540
00:29:48 --> 00:29:50
 the controversies

541
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
 on your previous incarnations

542

 you see
