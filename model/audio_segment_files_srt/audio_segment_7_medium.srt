1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:07
 They are looking as controversies to your eyes.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
 They are looking as different types of entertainments to my eyes.

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
 See, entertainment also must be different types.

4
00:00:20 --> 00:00:26
 Same entertainment will also bore.

5
00:00:26 --> 00:00:41
 So, the original intention of creating this universe is only ekaki naramate, only for entertainment.

6
00:00:41 --> 00:00:48
 And the situations are developed in such a way that God is entertained.

7
00:00:48 --> 00:01:02
 But at the same time, if you do deep analysis, whatever God did is justice.

8
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
 That is true.

9
00:01:04 --> 00:01:10
 But there is another statement.

10
00:01:10 --> 00:01:21
 If you do the deep analysis, whatever is justice, that alone is done by God.

11
00:01:21 --> 00:01:31
 Because of your petty mind, the inability of understanding of your mind, you are thinking it as injustice.

12
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
 I will give an example.

13
00:01:35 --> 00:01:43
 One should not tell a lie.

14
00:01:43 --> 00:01:57
 Krishna told Dharmaraja to tell a lie that Ashwathama is killed, so that Drona will be killed.

15
00:01:57 --> 00:02:06
 By telling a lie, killing a guru like Drona is injustice.

16
00:02:06 --> 00:02:13
 That is the understanding of Dharmaraja.

17
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
 He did not go more deep into the subject.

18
00:02:18 --> 00:02:27
 But the analysis of Krishna is, Drona is supporting Kavaravas.

19
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
 Kavaravas are on the side of injustice.

20
00:02:33 --> 00:02:46
 And it is very difficult to kill Drona, as long as the bow is in his hand, bow and arrow.

21
00:02:46 --> 00:02:53
 In Ramavatar also, Vali could not be fought.

22
00:02:53 --> 00:03:00
 Because anybody who fights with Vali, half strength of the opponent fellow will join the strength of Vali.

23
00:03:00 --> 00:03:05
 And the strength of Vali is always greater than the strength of the opponent.

24
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
 So nobody can defeat Vali.

25
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
 But Vali is doing lot of injustice.

26
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
 He should be killed.

27
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
 Rama killed from behind the tree.

28
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
 That is justified.

29
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
 Hence justified means,

30
00:03:25 --> 00:03:31
 hence justified means,

31
00:03:31 --> 00:03:38
 this is the tear of Subhashchandra Bose.

32
00:03:38 --> 00:03:46
 In getting the freedom, he prepared army.

33
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
 Let us fight with British people.

34
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
 Hence justified means.

35
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
 But Gandhi told, means justified hence.

36
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
 That is the difference between both of them.

37
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
 Both are correct.

38
00:04:02 --> 00:04:08
 Because if you take the case of Vali,

39
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
 Rama killing Vali from behind the tree

40
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
 is hence justified means.

41
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
 Because Vali is unjust,

42
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
 killing Vali is justice.

43
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
 So killing him from behind the tree,

44
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
 that is not injustice.

45
00:04:35 --> 00:04:42
 Killing a bad fellow through false means is justified.

46
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
 There hence justified means.

47
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
 Now means justified hence, what Gandhi told.

48
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
 That is also correct in different context.

49
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
 Suppose taking this example,

50
00:04:58 --> 00:05:03
 one fellow, such and such fellow is bad,

51
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
 because he is my enemy.

52
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
 He is not actually bad.

53
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
 Because he is my enemy, he is bad.

54
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
 So just like Rama killed Vali,

55
00:05:16 --> 00:05:21
 let me kill from his backside.

56
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
 He may exploit.

57
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
 Hence justified means.

58
00:05:28 --> 00:05:33
 In order to prevent it, means justified hence.

59
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
 Okay, you think that he is bad,

60
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
 then fight before him.

61
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
 Why do you kill him from the backside?

62
00:05:43 --> 00:05:50
 If he fights with him before, he cannot defeat him.

63
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
 So there means justified hence.

64
00:05:56 --> 00:06:02
 So that hence justified means is not exploited.

65
00:06:07 --> 00:06:25
 So you think that Krishna is wrong in saying to Dharmaraja

66
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
 that he should tell a lie to kill Drona.

67
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
 These things you take as contradictions.

68
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
 Of Dharma.

69
00:06:38 --> 00:06:43
 It is not a contradiction of Dharma, it is Dharma.

70
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
 Not because God has done, it is Dharma.

71
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
 Even by analysis it is Dharma.

72
00:06:51 --> 00:06:56
 He is supporting Kauravas.

73
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
 And unless he is killed, Kauravas cannot be killed.

74
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
 If Kauravas are not killed, injustice is not destroyed.

75
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
 Pandavas will not win, justice cannot be established.

76
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
 So what you feel as atrocity,

77
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
 that is correct even on analysis.

78
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
 Because you are unable to analyze,

79
00:07:19 --> 00:07:25
 you are talking as atrocities of the previous incarnations.

80
00:07:25 --> 00:07:32
 Previous incarnations mean same God as the previous incarnations.

81
00:07:32 --> 00:07:38
 You are criticizing the present God also about the past incarnations.

82
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
 Past incarnations are only dresses.

83
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
 The present incarnation is the person.

84
00:07:47 --> 00:07:52
 You are criticizing the bearer of the shirt, not the shirt.

85
00:07:56 --> 00:08:01
 So it is due to lack of the depth of your analysis,

86
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
 they appear as atrocities.

87
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
 How do you support those previous atrocities?

88
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
 You are putting first.

89
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
 They are not atrocities at all.

90
00:08:12 --> 00:08:19
 They appeared as atrocities because of the lack of your intelligence,

91
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
 the lack of your analysis, the lack of your deep analysis.

92
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
 Followed?

93
00:08:28 --> 00:08:29
 Yes.

94
00:08:34 --> 00:08:34
 Thank you Swami.

95
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
 Swami, I have a question completely related to pravritti.

96
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
 All householders often follow traditions of the society,

97
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
 thinking that that is only justice.

98
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
 They are expected to give money or varti gifts at marriages and other functions of the family.

99
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
 Those families already have enough wealth.

100
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
 Even a family member with low income is bound to give costly gifts,

101
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
 otherwise prestige is lost.

102
00:09:05 --> 00:09:11
 Even if good clothes or jewelry are not worn, people do bad comments and upset us.

103
00:09:11 --> 00:09:17
 So people are running after money to stand along with their peers in the society.

104
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
 Now how to divert the time and effort to God in this societal pressure of earning money?

105
00:09:23 --> 00:09:31
 Sometimes in the present invitation cards, no gifts are accepted.

106
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
 They are putting no gifts.

107
00:09:36 --> 00:09:37
 No gifts are accepted.

108
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
 Nobody is there putting gifts.

109
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
 See, the thing is everything is business.

110
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
 Pravritti is only business.

111
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
 You are going to the marriage function.

112
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
 You are taking meals.

113
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
 What is the cost of that meals?

114
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
 100 rupees.

115
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
 Or if you go to a hotel, some 200, 300 it may take.

116
00:10:04 --> 00:10:10
 You 300 cash and come back.

117
00:10:13 --> 00:10:14
 He will come to your function.

118
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
 He will also take meals and you.

119
00:10:20 --> 00:10:28
 Of course, you must compare how many items you have eaten there

120
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
 and how many items you have prepared here.

121
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
 There should be justice.

122
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
 It is all business only.

123
00:10:35 --> 00:10:40
 It is not love, real love.

124
00:10:44 --> 00:10:49
 Real love lies when you are in love.

125
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
 When you present something without any expectation in return.

126
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
 If you give anything to me, nothing will be returned back.

127
00:11:07 --> 00:11:14
 If you have true love, I am the best person for true love

128
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
 because nothing will be returned back.

129
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
 The true love also will come out.

130
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
 Its reality will come out.

131
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
 We all love you, Swami.

132
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
 I am telling you just an example.

133
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37
 Without aspiring anything in return, you must present that it is true love.

134
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
 But you give a silver tumbler.

135
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
 They give you a silver plate.

136
00:11:47 --> 00:11:47
 You compare.

137
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
 Our tumbler is bigger.

138
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
 This plate is smaller.

139
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
 What is the use of such a gift?

140
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
 It is all pure business.

141
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
 Nothing else.

142
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
 Only before God, the real devotion comes.

143
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
 There is no devotion between the human beings.

144
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
 There is no real love between the human beings.

145
00:12:19 --> 00:12:26
 The real love becomes, the word real love becomes meaningful only in the context of God.

146
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
 Not in the context of pravrti.

147
00:12:33 --> 00:12:35
 Only in nivrti it is correct.

148
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
 Because in Yajnavalkya says,

149
00:12:40 --> 00:12:48
 Yajnavalkya in Veda says that the loves of all these worldly bonds are false.

150
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
 They are not true.

151
00:12:51 --> 00:12:58
 A husband loves wife because she is giving happiness to him.

152
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
 A wife loves the husband because he is giving happiness to her.

153
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
 Atmanakkamaya sarvampriyambhavati,

154
00:13:16 --> 00:13:17
 ari pachyurva.

155
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
 Whatever I told is told in Veda.

156
00:13:24 --> 00:13:31
 So all the worldly loves are fraud.

157
00:13:31 --> 00:13:41
 But God loves the devotee because he loves somebody who is giving happiness to him.

158
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
 But if you take God as a devotee,

159
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
 God loves the devotee,

160
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
 but God doesn't expect any happiness from the devotee.

161
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
 He is already full of happiness.

162
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
 He is full of bliss.

163
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
 What kind of happiness he requires from a devotee?

164
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
 That he is devotion of bliss.

165
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
 The devotee will get happiness from the God,

166
00:14:21 --> 00:14:26
 but God need not get any happiness from any devotee, any human being, any soul.

167
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
 And when God loves the devotee, that is true love.

168
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
 Because there is no expectation of any happiness in return.

169
00:14:39 --> 00:14:45
 But what devotee by worshipping God, he expects some happiness from God through some boon.

170
00:14:46 --> 00:14:51
 So only in the nivruthi, in the context of God and devotee,

171
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00
 you will find true love, that too from the side of God only.

172
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
 When a person is in love with God,

173
00:15:09 --> 00:15:22
 when a person is loving you without aspiring anything from you,

174
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
 should you not behave in the same way towards the other person also?

175
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
 Is it not justified?

176
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
 Then why you aspire from God?

177
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
 Show me any person who is not aspiring from God.

178
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
 Everybody is aspiring.

179
00:15:41 --> 00:15:46
 If you put one coconut, if you break one coconut, he aspires something.

180
00:15:49 --> 00:15:51
 That water has gone on the floor.

181
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
 Those two halves have gone into your idli chutney.

182
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
 In fact, nothing you have done to God.

183
00:16:01 --> 00:16:06
 Where is the scope for you to aspire from God?

184
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
 What you have given to God?

185
00:16:09 --> 00:16:16
 That sound of breaking the coconut, which is also not sweet, which is very harsh.

186
00:16:17 --> 00:16:24
 That sound of breaking the coconut, which is also not sweet, which is very harsh.

187
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
 We have no right to aspire anything from God.

188
00:16:37 --> 00:16:44
 And because he loves truly us, we must sacrifice to God.

189
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
 You must reward the true love.

190
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
 You are rewarding false love in the world.

191
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
 You are not rewarding the true love of God.

192
00:16:56 --> 00:16:57
 What?

193
00:17:01 --> 00:17:01
 Is it not?

194
00:17:13 --> 00:17:21
 One husband took bath in the tank and came inside the house

195
00:17:22 --> 00:17:29
 and lied on the floor, acted like as if he is dead.

196
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
 The wife, you know, he did not rise.

197
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
 So I weep now, all the people will come.

198
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
 But inside the kitchen, just now the cooking is over.

199
00:17:46 --> 00:17:55
 Some curry and some tomato sambar already prepared.

200
00:17:57 --> 00:18:04
 She closed the doors, went inside the kitchen, ate all those.

201
00:18:05 --> 00:18:08
 Then washed, wiped her mouth.

202
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
 Then opened the doors and started weeping.

203
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
 All the relatives, neighbors thinking.

204
00:18:20 --> 00:18:21
 She is weeping.

205
00:18:22 --> 00:18:26
 For you, I have prepared all the items in the kitchen.

206
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
 Without you, you think you have gone.

207
00:18:31 --> 00:18:35
 Then the husband stood and started weeping.

208
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
 Then the husband stood.

209
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
 Just now you have eaten.

210
00:18:55 --> 00:18:59
 In Coimbatore, I have said, when somebody dies in the house,

211
00:18:59 --> 00:19:01
 people will be weeping.

212
00:19:01 --> 00:19:05
 And the relatives, friends, etc., they come and sit.

213
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
 They also start weeping, joining with them.

214
00:19:13 --> 00:19:15
 So many people will be weeping.

215
00:19:17 --> 00:19:19
 I was also there.

216
00:19:19 --> 00:19:23
 One lady is asking, the side lady, is anything prepared or not?

217
00:19:29 --> 00:19:37
 When the other lady told,

218
00:19:37 --> 00:19:39
 Upma is prepared.

219
00:19:41 --> 00:19:43
 Then she started weeping.

220
00:19:47 --> 00:19:49
 Actually I have seen.

221
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
 I have seen this.

222
00:19:59 --> 00:20:05
 So, is it over?

223
00:20:05 --> 00:20:07
 Any more questions?

224
00:20:09 --> 00:20:11
 Actually our time is half an hour.

225
00:20:13 --> 00:20:15
 Yes, Swami. It is already half an hour.

226
00:20:15 --> 00:20:17
 We are at 6 o'clock.

227
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
 Yes, but still if any question is there, I don't mind to answer.

228
00:20:23 --> 00:20:25
 Okay, Swami.

229
00:20:29 --> 00:20:33
 So, Swami, when Pandavas won the war, they got...

230
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
 One thing.

231
00:20:35 --> 00:20:39
 You put one year only, that gold.

232
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
 Or both years.

233
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
 One.

234
00:20:43 --> 00:20:47
 N.T. Ramarov did like that to become Chief Minister.

235
00:20:51 --> 00:20:53
 So our next Chief Minister...

236
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
 I will be very attentive to answer your question.

237
00:20:59 --> 00:21:01
 Tell me.

238
00:21:03 --> 00:21:05
 Tell me.

239
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
 Swami, when Pandavas won the war,

240
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
 with the help of Lord Krishna,

241
00:21:11 --> 00:21:15
 Lord Krishna, after helping them,

242
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
 he went to his kingdom.

243
00:21:17 --> 00:21:19
 He did not aspire for a single penny.

244
00:21:19 --> 00:21:21
 And it is told that when

245
00:21:21 --> 00:21:23
 money ends through Adharma,

246
00:21:23 --> 00:21:25
 we should not enjoy it.

247
00:21:25 --> 00:21:27
 And instead of that, we should give that wealth

248
00:21:27 --> 00:21:29
 to the welfare of the society.

249
00:21:29 --> 00:21:31
 Swami ji, here one context is that

250
00:21:31 --> 00:21:33
 even Arjuna fought for his righteous share.

251
00:21:33 --> 00:21:35
 Suppose in this Kali Yuga,

252
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
 if a person ends in justified means of 100 rupees,

253
00:21:37 --> 00:21:39
 at least one month,

254
00:21:39 --> 00:21:41
 he should not enjoy it.

255
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
 And if he does not enjoy it,

256
00:21:43 --> 00:21:45
 he should not enjoy it.

257
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
 So, when he is in the state of

258
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
 end of in justified means of 100 rupees,

259
00:21:50 --> 00:21:52
 at least one paisa, ten paisa will be there

260
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
 and injustice.

261
00:21:54 --> 00:21:56
 In that case,

262
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
 only

263
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
 by increasing devotion

264
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
 and knowledge,

265
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
 we can give that money

266
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
 to human incarnation of

267
00:22:08 --> 00:22:10
 God.

268
00:22:10 --> 00:22:12
 We can...

269
00:22:12 --> 00:22:14
 So, in that case,

270
00:22:14 --> 00:22:16
 that money will not be

271
00:22:16 --> 00:22:18
 useful, no, Swami ji, because anyhow

272
00:22:18 --> 00:22:20
 in Kali Yuga,

273
00:22:20 --> 00:22:22
 the money, if we give to our

274
00:22:22 --> 00:22:24
 like children

275
00:22:24 --> 00:22:26
 and all issues, anyhow

276
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
 it is going to

277
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
 waste our

278
00:22:30 --> 00:22:32
 like

279
00:22:32 --> 00:22:34
 that is going to be

280
00:22:34 --> 00:22:36
 unjust to them, right?

281
00:22:36 --> 00:22:38
 That is,

282
00:22:38 --> 00:22:40
 human incarnation,

283
00:22:40 --> 00:22:42
 as he is an Agni,

284
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
 he is a truth

285
00:22:44 --> 00:22:46
 and he is human incarnation,

286
00:22:46 --> 00:22:48
 so,

287
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
 we should give it to him.

288
00:22:50 --> 00:22:52
 We should give it

289
00:22:52 --> 00:22:54
 and all are no questions.

290
00:22:54 --> 00:22:56
 See, here,

291
00:23:00 --> 00:23:02
 God Krishna

292
00:23:02 --> 00:23:04
 took the

293
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
 Mahabharata war

294
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
 as his work.

295
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
 That is, to establish

296
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
 justice

297
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
 and to destroy injustice.

298
00:23:18 --> 00:23:20
 And his work

299
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
 was assisted by Pandavas.

300
00:23:22 --> 00:23:24
 He should pay to

301
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
 Pandavas.

302
00:23:28 --> 00:23:30
 Not Pandavas give to Krishna.

303
00:23:32 --> 00:23:34
 Krishna should give to Pandavas.

304
00:23:36 --> 00:23:38
 Because what he tells,

305
00:23:38 --> 00:23:40
 this is my work.

306
00:23:40 --> 00:23:42
 First, Arjuna thinks

307
00:23:42 --> 00:23:44
 that he is fighting

308
00:23:44 --> 00:23:46
 for his selfish purpose,

309
00:23:46 --> 00:23:48
 to earn his

310
00:23:48 --> 00:23:50
 justified share.

311
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
 I don't want that share.

312
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56
 I cannot kill my grandfather.

313
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
 That was his argument.

314
00:24:00 --> 00:24:02
 Then how Krishna

315
00:24:02 --> 00:24:04
 turned on that concept?

316
00:24:04 --> 00:24:06
 He told,

317
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
 you fellow, this is not your work.

318
00:24:08 --> 00:24:10
 Even if you go out of the war,

319
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
 I will kill them.

320
00:24:20 --> 00:24:22
 Even if you are not fighting,

321
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
 I am going to kill them.

322
00:24:26 --> 00:24:28
 Already I have killed them.

323
00:24:28 --> 00:24:30
 You kill

324
00:24:30 --> 00:24:32
 the already killed persons.

325
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
 I have killed them.

326
00:24:36 --> 00:24:38
 Whose work?

327
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
 Dharma samsthapan arthaya

328
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
 sambhavami yuge yuge

329
00:24:42 --> 00:24:44
 This is not my

330
00:24:44 --> 00:24:46
 new work.

331
00:24:46 --> 00:24:48
 In every yuga,

332
00:24:48 --> 00:24:50
 I

333
00:24:50 --> 00:24:52
 incarnated myself

334
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
 to destroy injustice.

335
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
 Similarly, on the same work,

336
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
 I am incarnated now.

337
00:25:00 --> 00:25:02
 I am doing my work.

338
00:25:02 --> 00:25:04
 You are not killing them.

339
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
 I am killing them.

340
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
 I am doing my own work.

341
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
 You just assist me,

342
00:25:12 --> 00:25:14
 appear as if you have assisted me

343
00:25:14 --> 00:25:16
 and get the fee.

344
00:25:26 --> 00:25:28
 Already I have killed them.

345
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
 They are unjust people.

346
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
 So,

347
00:25:32 --> 00:25:34
 you participate

348
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
 in my work,

349
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
 being my devotee.

350
00:25:38 --> 00:25:40
 In that case,

351
00:25:40 --> 00:25:42
 God is greater

352
00:25:42 --> 00:25:44
 than your grandfather.

353
00:25:46 --> 00:25:48
 You must be prepared to kill

354
00:25:48 --> 00:25:50
 the grandfather for the sake of God.

355
00:25:52 --> 00:25:54
 Don't kill your grandfather

356
00:25:54 --> 00:25:56
 for your sake.

357
00:25:56 --> 00:25:58
 To get the right share

358
00:25:58 --> 00:26:00
 of the property,

359
00:26:00 --> 00:26:02
 then Arjuna is killing

360
00:26:02 --> 00:26:04
 grandfather for his share,

361
00:26:04 --> 00:26:06
 for his work.

362
00:26:08 --> 00:26:10
 Now,

363
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
 I am destroying injustice.

364
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
 Bhishma is supporting unjust

365
00:26:16 --> 00:26:18
 kauravas.

366
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
 You kill

367
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
 your grandfather

368
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
 for my sake. I am greater than your grandfather.

369
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
 That is how he turned the entire

370
00:26:30 --> 00:26:32
 angle of Mahabharata war.

371
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
 Then Arjuna

372
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
 killed Bhishma,

373
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
 killed Drona,

374
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
 the teacher.

375
00:26:42 --> 00:26:44
 The grandfather and the teacher

376
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46
 are not greater

377
00:26:46 --> 00:26:48
 than God Krishna.

378
00:26:48 --> 00:26:50
 Now, this war

379
00:26:50 --> 00:26:52
 is my work.

380
00:26:52 --> 00:26:54
 You are assisting

381
00:26:54 --> 00:26:56
 me in my work.

382
00:26:58 --> 00:27:00
 Not your work.

383
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
 Since it is my work,

384
00:27:02 --> 00:27:04
 you will not get anything.

385
00:27:06 --> 00:27:08
 If you are killing Bhishma

386
00:27:08 --> 00:27:10
 for this, earning your

387
00:27:10 --> 00:27:12
 share of the kingdom

388
00:27:12 --> 00:27:14
 for the sake of money, property

389
00:27:14 --> 00:27:16
 means money, then it is

390
00:27:16 --> 00:27:18
 a sin.

391
00:27:18 --> 00:27:20
 For your selfishness,

392
00:27:20 --> 00:27:22
 you have killed the grandfather.

393
00:27:22 --> 00:27:24
 But now,

394
00:27:24 --> 00:27:26
 I am going to kill

395
00:27:26 --> 00:27:28
 kauravas because they are

396
00:27:28 --> 00:27:30
 on the side of

397
00:27:30 --> 00:27:32
 injustice.

398
00:27:32 --> 00:27:34
 This is my work.

399
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
 You are helping me

400
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
 as my servant, as my

401
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
 devotee.

402
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
 And when you are helping God

403
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
 as a devotee

404
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
 or as a servant, grandfather

405
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
 and teacher are not greater than God.

406
00:27:48 --> 00:27:50
 You can kill them.

407
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
 You killed them.

408
00:27:54 --> 00:27:56
 That is how Krishna

409
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
 turned the angle.

410
00:28:00 --> 00:28:02
 The angle of Arjuna

411
00:28:02 --> 00:28:04
 was completely turned.

412
00:28:08 --> 00:28:10
 And when Sanjaya told

413
00:28:10 --> 00:28:12
 Dhritarashtra about

414
00:28:12 --> 00:28:14
 all this Bhagavad Gita,

415
00:28:14 --> 00:28:16
 Dhritarashtra scolds Krishna,

416
00:28:16 --> 00:28:18
 that fellow is responsible.

417
00:28:18 --> 00:28:20
 If that fellow is not there,

418
00:28:20 --> 00:28:22
 Arjuna would have not fought.

419
00:28:22 --> 00:28:24
 Then the kingdom

420
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
 must have come to my son.

421
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
 That fellow is

422
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
 the real problem.

423
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 Did you follow

424
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
 what I told?

425
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
 Swamiji, in every context

426
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
 you are telling that intention,

427
00:28:44 --> 00:28:46
 intention, every fruit

428
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
 depends on the intention.

429
00:28:52 --> 00:28:54
 You see, I am telling in this present

430
00:28:54 --> 00:28:56
 context, it is the intention

431
00:28:56 --> 00:28:58
 only that decides the sin,

432
00:28:58 --> 00:29:00
 the fruit,

433
00:29:00 --> 00:29:02
 whether it is sin

434
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
 or merit.

435
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
 If your intention is to serve

436
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
 God Krishna

437
00:29:08 --> 00:29:10
 in his work, then

438
00:29:10 --> 00:29:12
 the fruit is punyam.

439
00:29:12 --> 00:29:14
 If your intention

440
00:29:14 --> 00:29:16
 is to earn your property share

441
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
 even by killing grandfather,

442
00:29:20 --> 00:29:22
 that is sin, that is papa.

443
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
 Here also,

444
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
 the intention decides

445
00:29:26 --> 00:29:28
 the fruit.

446
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
 If you are fighting

447
00:29:30 --> 00:29:32
 with the intention

448
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
 of getting your share

449
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
 by killing

450
00:29:36 --> 00:29:38
 Bhishma,

451
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
 are you following?

452
00:29:40 --> 00:29:42
 Then

453
00:29:42 --> 00:29:44
 you know, then

454
00:29:44 --> 00:29:46
