1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
 Human being cooperated, God component there.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:12
 What is the purpose of human incarnation so that you can talk directly with God, you can

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
 see God?

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
 Is it not?

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:21
 Unless that human being component became God, by seeing that human being component, how

6
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
 can you say that you have seen God?

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
 Unless both become one?

8
00:00:27 --> 00:00:34
 If both are not one, human being is human being, God is God, by seeing human being,

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:40
 God is invisible, unimaginable, by seeing human being, how can you say that you have

10
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
 seen God?

11
00:00:43 --> 00:00:49
 And when you have not seen God, what is the use of the human incarnation?

12
00:00:49 --> 00:00:57
 You wanted human incarnation to see God, to talk with God, to touch God, to live with

13
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
 God.

14
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
 I give you this time.

15
00:01:01 --> 00:01:10
 Unless human being became God, how can you get these four meaningful?

16
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
 Is it not?

17
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
 So therefore, in that context, he is both sat and asat.

18
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
 But avyaktam you have brought that word.

19
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
 Avyaktam means sat visible and sat invisible is avyaktam.

20
00:01:28 --> 00:01:35
 Sat visible is vyaktam, in gross state.

21
00:01:35 --> 00:01:41
 And when the same sat goes to the subtle state, it is avyaktam.

22
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
 Sat is common.

23
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
 You see visible light.

24
00:01:47 --> 00:01:54
 That is energy, that is invisible, that is vyaktam.

25
00:01:54 --> 00:02:03
 But the same energy goes to the invisible state like gamma rays, x-rays, etc.

26
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
 There also the same energy is existing.

27
00:02:06 --> 00:02:11
 Sat is there, but it is invisible, avyaktam.

28
00:02:11 --> 00:02:18
 Avyaktam means invisible, existing, invisible.

29
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
 This is existing, visible.

30
00:02:22 --> 00:02:29
 So sat stays in two stages, avyaktam and vyaktam.

31
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
 And sat remains as sat.

32
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
 In subtle state it is existing.

33
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
 Gamma rays you are not seeing.

34
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
 But gamma rays energy is existing.

35
00:02:45 --> 00:02:50
 Visible light you are seeing.

36
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
 There also energy is existing.

37
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
 Existence is not changing.

38
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
 Only visible and invisible states are changing.

39
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
 You follow?

40
00:03:02 --> 00:03:09
 Yes, there also.

41
00:03:09 --> 00:03:22
 Avyaktam yaktimapannam manyante mam abuddhaya.

42
00:03:22 --> 00:03:32
 They say that the unimaginable God, here you are referring avyaktam means unimaginable

43
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
 God.

44
00:03:33 --> 00:03:41
 Now the point is gamma radiation is avyaktam.

45
00:03:41 --> 00:03:52
 It is avyaktam, but through some powerful microscope you can see it, it can become vyaktam.

46
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
 You take the case of parabrahman, unimaginable God.

47
00:03:56 --> 00:04:03
 It is also avyaktam like gamma radiation for the eyes.

48
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
 For the eyes it is not seen.

49
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
 It is why it is avyaktam.

50
00:04:06 --> 00:04:14
 Like gamma radiation, parabrahman is also avyaktam, invisible.

51
00:04:14 --> 00:04:24
 But through microscope you can see gamma radiation, but through microscope you cannot see parabrahman.

52
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
 But in both common is invisibility.

53
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
 Invisibility is common, both are invisible.

54
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
 But that parabrahman is unimaginable.

55
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
 This gamma radiation is imaginable.

56
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
 This gamma radiation is imaginable, invisible.

57
00:04:45 --> 00:04:50
 Parabrahman is unimaginable, invisible.

58
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
 Common property, invisibility is there.

59
00:04:53 --> 00:05:00
 By common property you cannot say that parabrahman is gamma radiation.

60
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
 There is differential property also, that is God is unimaginable and gamma radiation

61
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
 is imaginable.

62
00:05:07 --> 00:05:15
 There is a differentiating factor and there is a common factor.

63
00:05:15 --> 00:05:27
 So there the sloka which you read, avyaktam yaktimapanam, I am the unimaginable God, at

64
00:05:27 --> 00:05:31
 the same time invisible also.

65
00:05:31 --> 00:05:42
 Ignorant people think that suppose the gamma radiation frequency is increased, it becomes

66
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
 visible.

67
00:05:43 --> 00:05:53
 Now for gamma radiation parabrahman there is one commonality, that is invisibility.

68
00:05:53 --> 00:06:01
 Just like the invisible gamma radiation became the visible light, similarly the invisible

69
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
 parabrahman became visible, people full stick like that.

70
00:06:05 --> 00:06:13
 Based on the commonality of the factor, they equalize both, but there is a differential

71
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
 factor that God is unimaginable, gamma radiation is imaginable.

72
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
 Are you following?

73
00:06:21 --> 00:06:35
 Abuddhaya, foolish people think that since I am invisible avyaktam, yaktimapanam, I became

74
00:06:35 --> 00:06:36
 visible.

75
00:06:36 --> 00:06:44
 Because invisible can become visible, invisible gamma radiation is becoming visible light

76
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
 by reducing the frequency.

77
00:06:49 --> 00:06:59
 Like that, myself parabrahman also invisible became visible, that is what fools think.

78
00:06:59 --> 00:07:06
 Based on the commonality factor, both are invisible, but there is a differential factor.

79
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
 I am unimaginable, that is imaginable.

80
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
 So I will not become visible.

81
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
 I will never become visible.

82
00:07:18 --> 00:07:27
 Nobody can see God with eyes, even with mind.

83
00:07:27 --> 00:07:57
 When that unimaginable and invisible God gets mediated, I am become visible.

84
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
 No, that you should not apply.

85
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
 He got mediated and appeared.

86
00:08:07 --> 00:08:08
 Mediated and appeared.

87
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
 Not reduced the frequency.

88
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
 That you can apply to gamma radiation.

89
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
 Not to God.

90
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
 God here became visible.

91
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
 Understand?

92
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
 Your wife is sleeping.

93
00:08:34 --> 00:08:46
 So there, the unimaginable God became visible not due to reduction of frequency like gamma

94
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
 radiation becoming visible light.

95
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
 He became visible due to mediation.

96
00:08:54 --> 00:09:02
 Because the unimaginable God is non-mediated, he is invisible and he is unimaginable.

97
00:09:02 --> 00:09:07
 That unimaginable God became mediated.

98
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
 Therefore I am seen.

99
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
 That is the meaning of kashin man veg tattvatah.

100
00:09:21 --> 00:09:26
 Kashin man veg tattvatah means one understands me, one sees me.

101
00:09:26 --> 00:09:31
 Does not mean that one can see the unimaginable God.

102
00:09:31 --> 00:09:36
 That does not mean that one can understand the unimaginable God.

103
00:09:36 --> 00:09:46
 That means the unimaginable God who got mediated himself and appeared is the same unimaginable

104
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
 God and mediated.

105
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
 Like that he understands.

106
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
 Kashin man veg tattvatah.

107
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
 He understands me as parabrahman.

108
00:09:57 --> 00:10:02
 Because there I was unmediated, here I am mediated.

109
00:10:05 --> 00:10:14
 A naked fellow in the bathroom is wrapped by dress, came out and is seen by people.

110
00:10:15 --> 00:10:24
 The same naked person condensed himself into a clothed person and came out.

111
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
 That is another thing.

112
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
 You follow?

113
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
 Yes.

114
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
 All of you understand?

115
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
 Swami in continuation.

116
00:10:41 --> 00:10:46
 When unimaginable is already discussed, why is it again talking about invisible?

117
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
 When it is not imaginable, why talking about invisibility, Swami?

118
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
 You talk slowly, first let me understand.

119
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
 If you talk fast I cannot understand.

120
00:10:56 --> 00:11:02
 When you said it is unimaginable, God is unimaginable, unimaginable means like you cannot imagine anything.

121
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
 Yes.

122
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
 Why do we say invisible when you already used unimaginable?

123
00:11:09 --> 00:11:14
 Because we have brought gamma radiation in comparison.

124
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
 Gamma radiation is imaginable and invisible.

125
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
 Parabrahman is unimaginable and invisible.

126
00:11:24 --> 00:11:33
 To show that commonality factor, I added this visible word to parabrahman also.

127
00:11:34 --> 00:11:39
 Then only I can compare gamma radiation with the unimaginable God.

128
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
 What is the commonality factor?

129
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
 Both are invisible.

130
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
 Then shall I use the word invisible for parabrahman also or not?

131
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
 Hrusheekeshi is red in color.

132
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
 Kartikey is also red in color.

133
00:11:59 --> 00:12:04
 Then, no, no, you should not say Hrusheekeshi is red in color.

134
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
 Like that how can you say?

135
00:12:08 --> 00:12:15
 To show the commonality, I am telling Hrusheekeshi is red, Kartikey is red.

136
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
 No, no, you say Kartikey is red but not Hrusheekeshi.

137
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
 Unless I say both, how can I show commonality?

138
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
 Today's satsang is very deep.

139
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
 Swami, there are questions from online. Shall I read, Swami?

140
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
 Yes, yes.

141
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
 This question is from Manikanta.

142
00:12:56 --> 00:13:01
 If unimaginable God is avyaktam, how can we say He exists?

143
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
 How can we say He exists?

144
00:13:05 --> 00:13:16
 He exists because He got mediated and He is performing miracles.

145
00:13:16 --> 00:13:25
 See, the same unimaginable God became imaginable and visible.

146
00:13:25 --> 00:13:35
 The same unimaginable and invisible God became imaginable and visible by getting mediated.

147
00:13:36 --> 00:13:46
 The unimaginable miracles, the source of unimaginable miracles can be only unimaginable God.

148
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52
 And when the mediated God also is doing the same miracles,

149
00:13:52 --> 00:14:03
 that means the same unmediated God, unimaginable God, became the mediated, imaginable and visible God.

150
00:14:04 --> 00:14:11
 Because of the commonality of the unimaginable events called miracles in both of them.

151
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
 Now here, one more correlation also can be given.

152
00:14:17 --> 00:14:30
 The fellow who was taking bath in the bathroom, he came, he finished bath and he got himself dressed and came out.

153
00:14:31 --> 00:14:37
 When he came out, still some parts of his body are visible.

154
00:14:38 --> 00:14:46
 That same naked fellow's parts, the legs are visible, the face is visible, the hands are visible.

155
00:14:47 --> 00:14:55
 So, even the same unimaginable God became visible partially.

156
00:14:56 --> 00:15:03
 Because the dress cannot completely cover from top to legs, then people will run away.

157
00:15:04 --> 00:15:13
 When Jesus told Lazarus, come out, come out, then he came out all wrapped with cloth, you know.

158
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
 Nothing is seen.

159
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
 Not like that.

160
00:15:18 --> 00:15:23
 He came with pants, a lungi and a shirt, hands are seen.

161
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
 Hands are seen, feet are seen.

162
00:15:27 --> 00:15:32
 So even though he got mediated, some original part is seen.

163
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
 What is that part?

164
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
 That is the unimaginable events called miracles.

165
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
 Partly he is seen, his legs are seen, his face is seen, his hands are seen.

166
00:15:51 --> 00:15:58
 Some unimaginable portion of unimaginable God becomes also visible.

167
00:16:00 --> 00:16:08
 And that portion which becomes visible is the unimaginable miracle done by God Datta.

168
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
 So what is the question?

169
00:16:18 --> 00:16:25
 If unimaginable God is avyaktam, how can we say he exists?

170
00:16:26 --> 00:16:27
 Ah, exists.

171
00:16:28 --> 00:16:39
 You see, the characteristic of unimaginable God is performing unimaginable event.

172
00:16:40 --> 00:16:47
 That is the characteristic of unimaginable God.

173
00:16:48 --> 00:16:53
 The unimaginable God became imaginable God by mediation.

174
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
 And he is performing the same miracle.

175
00:17:00 --> 00:17:07
 This miracle gives the clue of the existence of unimaginable God.

176
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
 That is called as inference.

177
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
 Anumana pramana.

178
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
 It is based on prachacha pramana.

179
00:17:19 --> 00:17:25
 That is, we have seen the unimaginable events performed by unimaginable God.

180
00:17:26 --> 00:17:34
 The same unimaginable events are also seen in this imaginable God, visible God.

181
00:17:35 --> 00:17:42
 Therefore that unimaginable God must be existing in this mediated God, mediated person.

182
00:17:43 --> 00:17:49
 Just like you have seen in the kitchen that smoke is coming from fire.

183
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
 There you have seen both fire and smoke.

184
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
 Now you are going, from the top of the hill some smoke is coming.

185
00:18:01 --> 00:18:14
 Based on your perception knowledge in the kitchen, now you will say since smoke is coming, there must be fire on the hill.

186
00:18:15 --> 00:18:22
 The knowledge that is attained by inference is called as induction.

187
00:18:23 --> 00:18:28
 The knowledge that is attained from perception is called as deduction.

188
00:18:29 --> 00:18:38
 Based on the deduction, that is, you have seen smoke coming from the fire in the kitchen.

189
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
 Then you will have vyapti, that is generalization.

190
00:18:44 --> 00:18:46
 Wherever there is smoke, there must be fire.

191
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
 Now you have seen smoke from the hill.

192
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
 You are not seeing fire.

193
00:18:54 --> 00:19:03
 But based on the generalization of the deduction, your induction conclusion is that there is fire on the hill.

194
00:19:06 --> 00:19:14
 So not only perception is a proof for existence, but inference is also a proof for existence.

195
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
 Yes, Swami.

196
00:19:29 --> 00:19:32
 Swami, there is one more question from online. Shall I read, Swami?

197
00:19:34 --> 00:19:37
 The following question is from Ms. Amudha.

198
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
 Pada Namaskaran, Swami.

199
00:19:41 --> 00:19:49
 What is moksha? Love for God is moksha or basic self-love is moksha or both?

200
00:19:50 --> 00:19:51
 Both.

201
00:19:58 --> 00:20:05
 See, moksha means, simple direct meaning of moksha is liberation.

202
00:20:08 --> 00:20:17
 When you are bound by something, suppose you are bound by a rope and somebody came and cut the rope.

203
00:20:18 --> 00:20:20
 You got moksha from the rope.

204
00:20:21 --> 00:20:25
 Moksha means liberation, simply liberation.

205
00:20:26 --> 00:20:30
 You can use that word in any context.

206
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
 I got liberation from the rope.

207
00:20:35 --> 00:20:38
 I got liberation from this husband.

208
00:20:40 --> 00:20:41
 That is also moksha?

209
00:20:41 --> 00:20:46
 Yes, Maya, I got moksha from my husband.

210
00:20:49 --> 00:20:51
 Moksha means simply liberation.

211
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
 If you love both yourself and God, where is moksha?

212
00:21:01 --> 00:21:02
 It's not.

213
00:21:03 --> 00:21:15
 So, the person who loves himself is liberated from God. That is moksha.

214
00:21:20 --> 00:21:24
 The person who loves God is liberated from himself.

215
00:21:25 --> 00:21:26
 That is moksha.

216
00:21:27 --> 00:21:29
 So there are two types of moksha.

217
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
 Whichever you like, you have.

218
00:21:33 --> 00:21:34
 Who objected?

219
00:21:35 --> 00:21:40
 Indian constitution has given freedom, fundamental rights, freedom.

220
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
 Seven fundamental rights are given.

221
00:21:44 --> 00:21:49
 Freedom of speech, freedom of expression, like that.

222
00:21:50 --> 00:21:53
 So if you want freedom from varayad.

223
00:21:54 --> 00:22:02
 One thing, if you get freedom from one thing, you will get attachment to another thing.

224
00:22:03 --> 00:22:05
 Attachment means yoga.

225
00:22:06 --> 00:22:13
 Yoga, actual translation is union, attainment.

226
00:22:14 --> 00:22:15
 That is yoga.

227
00:22:16 --> 00:22:18
 Moksha means liberation.

228
00:22:19 --> 00:22:20
 Moksha means liberation.

229
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
 Attainment of God, if you want.

230
00:22:25 --> 00:22:30
 You liberate yourself from all the worldly bonds, including yourself.

231
00:22:31 --> 00:22:34
 You are bonded to yourself, love of myself.

232
00:22:35 --> 00:22:37
 That is also a worldly bond.

233
00:22:42 --> 00:22:45
 That also one has to get liberation.

234
00:22:45 --> 00:22:49
 When Krishna died, all gopikas jumped into fire.

235
00:22:51 --> 00:22:53
 That means they got liberation from themselves.

236
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
 From that I, they got liberation.

237
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
 That is why they jumped into fire.

238
00:23:03 --> 00:23:08
 Ramakrishna Brahman, he could not see mother Kali.

239
00:23:09 --> 00:23:19
 He was trying very much tortured because mother did not appear.

240
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
 Then he jumped on a knife.

241
00:23:23 --> 00:23:25
 Then mother appeared.

242
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
 He jumped on knife means he got liberation from himself.

243
00:23:31 --> 00:23:35
 From the love of himself, love of I.

244
00:23:36 --> 00:23:38
 From that also he got liberation.

245
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
 Then only he jumped.

246
00:23:42 --> 00:23:47
 He tried to sacrifice his life, that is himself, for the sake of God.

247
00:23:50 --> 00:23:59
 So all the worldly bonds, liberation from all the worldly bonds is necessary to attain God.

248
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
 But the actual concept is that

249
00:24:10 --> 00:24:18
 instead of you forcibly trying to liberate yourself from the worldly bonds,

250
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
 better you attach to God so that worldly bonds themselves will drop.

251
00:24:30 --> 00:24:32
 That is very easy.

252
00:24:33 --> 00:24:35
 There is no need of any strain.

253
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
 Instead of leaving wife and children by fighting,

254
00:24:43 --> 00:24:48
 suppose you are always immersed in God, they will themselves leave you.

255
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53
 They will put you in your room lock and then go to cinema.

256
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
 They themselves drop.

257
00:24:59 --> 00:25:01
 You need not put any effort.

258
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
 Just like the Sardar came inside, goat went outside.

259
00:25:12 --> 00:25:14
 You know that joke?

260
00:25:15 --> 00:25:16
 Sardar and goat joke.

261
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
 You don't know?

262
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
 See, one goat was kept in a room.

263
00:25:23 --> 00:25:29
 And from each state, one person is sent into the room.

264
00:25:30 --> 00:25:35
 How many minutes this fellow can bear the smell of the goat?

265
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
 One list is prepared.

266
00:25:40 --> 00:25:43
 Andhra Pradesh fellow went, 10 minutes he could bear.

267
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
 Telangana person went, some 12 minutes he could bear.

268
00:25:49 --> 00:25:53
 Manjap Pradesh person went, 15 minutes he could bear.

269
00:25:54 --> 00:25:56
 Some list is being prepared.

270
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
 But when Sardar, Punjab, when Sardar went inside, the goat came outside.

271
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10
 Now these judges went to the chairman and asked him,

272
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
 what value we have to put?

273
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
 For that fellow, 10 minutes.

274
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
 For this fellow, 12 minutes.

275
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
 For this fellow, 15 minutes.

276
00:26:23 --> 00:26:25
 For Sardar, how many minutes we have to put?

277
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
 That joke has got a lot of importance in spiritual knowledge.

278
00:26:37 --> 00:26:42
 You can learn the real clue of salvation from that joke.

279
00:26:45 --> 00:26:48
 No, don't fight with family members.

280
00:26:50 --> 00:26:52
 Get yourself immersed in God always.

281
00:26:53 --> 00:26:58
 You have tasted His sweetness of God.

282
00:26:59 --> 00:27:01
 And you are immersed in God.

283
00:27:02 --> 00:27:04
 The sweetness of God.

284
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
 And you are immersed in God.

285
00:27:08 --> 00:27:10
 The devasas will leave you.

286
00:27:11 --> 00:27:13
 No need of fighting, no need of quarrel.

287
00:27:16 --> 00:27:18
 Spontaneously drop out.

288
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
 How is for salvation, this is the easiest method.

289
00:27:25 --> 00:27:27
 Get detachment by attachment.

290
00:27:28 --> 00:27:33
 You will always get real detachment by another real attachment.

291
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
 Suppose you are seeing cinema.

292
00:27:37 --> 00:27:42
 You are so much attached and immersed in the cinema that even mosquitoes bite you.

293
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
 Even the blood bugs swallow your blood.

294
00:27:47 --> 00:27:49
 You are not aware.

295
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
 Detach from all those things.

296
00:27:53 --> 00:27:55
 Because of your attachment in the cinema.

297
00:27:57 --> 00:28:02
 Always real detachment comes from only another real attachment.

298
00:28:04 --> 00:28:09
 Without another real attachment, you cannot get real detachment.

299
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
 You have tasted the divine nectar.

300
00:28:15 --> 00:28:17
 Then coffee dropped by itself.

301
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
 Even if somebody forces you to drink coffee.

302
00:28:22 --> 00:28:24
 No, no, I don't like coffee.

303
00:28:25 --> 00:28:31
 But without tasting divine nectar, you leave coffee by force.

304
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
 Some four days you can leave.

305
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
 Fifth day one bucket of coffee you will drink.

306
00:28:40 --> 00:28:47
 So we can say it is impossible to get real detachment without another real attachment.

307
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
 It is impossible.

308
00:28:51 --> 00:28:53
 Not only impossible, but also waste.

309
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
 Because I am leaving coffee.

310
00:29:00 --> 00:29:05
 And leaving coffee is not a prerequisite to get divine nectar.

311
00:29:06 --> 00:29:10
 If you want to get divine nectar, you must leave coffee. There is no rule.

312
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
 So by leaving coffee you are not getting divine nectar.

313
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
 It is not a prerequisite rule.

314
00:29:20 --> 00:29:22
 Then what happens?

315
00:29:23 --> 00:29:26
 You have lost both coffee and divine nectar.

316
00:29:27 --> 00:29:29
 At least have coffee.

317
00:29:30 --> 00:29:32
 If divine nectar is not updated.

318
00:29:33 --> 00:29:41
 At least have coffee because the mind has got one terrible quality that it should be attached to something always.

319
00:29:42 --> 00:29:48
 Without attachment to anything the mind cannot stay alone.

320
00:29:49 --> 00:29:57
 Therefore it is impossible to get detachment without another attachment.

321
00:29:58 --> 00:30:00
 Mind will rebel.
