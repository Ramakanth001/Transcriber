brain is if we give meals to him today, what is its cost?. Only that will be, that will enter into the brain.. So anyway, they are also my children only.. I must give more attention for them.. That is why I have published so many books in Telugu.. So okay.. Yes Swami.. Swami, next question Swami.. This question is from Miss Bhargavi.. Namaskaram Swami.. Whenever I say something related to human incarnations, my friends usually don't trust.. Some even ask why you even believe these incarnations when we already have so many gods.. I am not good at explaining the importance of human incarnations.. I am afraid they might make fun of human incarnations which is a sin.. I know you understand my situation as you are Sarvajna.. What should I do Swami?. See you simply put one question to them.. Who is the greatest devotee of God in this creation so far?. Hanuman and Radha.. Hanuman has gone to Brahma Loka, Satchaloka.. Radha has gone to Goloka.. Is there a greater devotee than Hanuman and Radha you ask?. See you at least examine the fruits they got.. Brahma Loka is the ultimate loka of world of God.. That is ultimate abode of God.. Goloka is higher than Brahma Loka, higher than the abode of God.. Who reached these two highest fruits?. Hanuman and Radha.. Hanuman and Radha both worshipped contemporary human incarnations.. Not even past human incarnations.. We worshipped Rama and Krishna, past human incarnations.. But we don't worship contemporary human incarnations.. Hanuman and Radha are not like that.. Hanuman did not worship Vamana and Narasimha, past human incarnations.. Hanuman worshipped Rama, his contemporary human incarnations.. Krishna, Gokas did not worship Rama.. They worshipped Krishna, the contemporary human incarnations.. And both Hanuman and Gokas got the highest fruit.. What more logic is needed if he doesn't understand this much?. He doesn't have brain in his head.. No brain in his head.. And such fellow, you cannot do anything.. See there is a shloka.. In a village, everywhere municipal water taps are there.. Very good water is coming.. One fellow in his house, one well is there.. That well is full of salt water.. But that fellow drinks only that water,. telling, my father dug this well.. Since my father dug this well,. I will drink water only from that,. even if it is saltiest and hardest water.. I will not drink soft water.. What can you do with that fellow?. Just leave him.. For that person, this much logic is sufficient.. Do you agree Rama and Krishna are Gods?. Definitely.. Do you agree that Ramayanam and Bhagavatam are the highest epics?. Yes, they are highest epics.. Do you agree that Hanuman and Radha are the highest epics?. Do you agree that Hanuman and Radha. worshipped only contemporary human incarnations?. They never worshipped energetic incarnations.. Nor they worshipped past human incarnations.. They worshipped only contemporary human incarnations.. And they got highest fruits.. Nobody got any fruit equal to them.. Sufficient, there is no need of further.. These four or five sentences are sufficient.. If he has got some gujju,. grain in his head,. he will follow.. Swami, doubt.. Yes.. As a part of propagation of the divine knowledge,. we are meeting with many people like this. and we are also posting your discourses, cut, paste,. in that manner.. Sometimes we are discussing like that the process is going on.. But in spite of listening and reading all those things,. the people are very rigid,. that ignoring, not accepting, not rejecting,. just ignoring and want to continue chatting with me.. That is how can I deal with them?. Shall I continue propagation?. See, you continue your propagation,. it will take time to get the result.. The initial stage itself, excellent results will not come.. One lady was advised to do pradashnams to people three. to get issues.. One round she does and she is so happy.. Rather pregnant she has to do pradashnams.. It will take time.. Some time it will take.. Definitely one day,. definitely one day,. Narshtar Damas told,. one day all religions will disappear.. Only one religion will remain in this entire world.. One fellow will come from a country surrounded by three seas.. He is not only a Sanskrit scholar,. but also a scientist.. These are written by Narshtar Damas.. All religions will disappear. and only the Vedic religion established by him will remain.. And in the entire universe,. Thursday will become holiday.. That is, Gaurdharta's day.. So it is going to happen.. One day, myself and Pani went to,. we were talking with Koneer Sachinarayanan,. chairman of KL University.. He was telling,. backside there was a big Hanuman's photo. and he was telling,. human incarnation is so much valid like that.. Then I told,. sir, I worked there,. sir, backside of you,. big photo of Hanuman is there,. whom he worshipped.. He was stunned.. Then he told,. Swami, one day,. your knowledge will drown the entire world like tsunami.. He was also there.. So,. one day the result will come.. Let the pradakshams be completed.. Let her become pregnant.. Yes.. Next.. Swami, next question is from Ms. Snehita.. Swami, if all human forms of God,. like Dutta, Satya Sai Baba, Jesus, Allah, etc.. and all of them commonly preach,. God is one,. then why do we have so many religions?. You see,. the internal God is only one.. But the external dresses are different.. Suppose in a cloth shop,. are they not keeping different dresses?. Only one person is going to wear all the dresses.. So,. these external forms. are chosen by devotees as per their tastes.. Somebody likes Hanuman,. somebody likes Rama,. somebody likes Krishna,. somebody likes Dutta.. The dresses have different colours.. Similarly, the external forms. have different qualities.. The entire humanity,. each human being is having a specific quality,. liking for a specific quality.. As per his liking or her liking,. the dress can be selected.. The person wearing that dress,. all dresses are one and the same.. But the dress is not the same.. All dresses are one and the same.. But there is fascination for dress. apart from the fascination to the person.. Even though the wife is fascinated. to the husband,. she says,. you wear this dress,. this dress will be good for you.. No, no, no, don't come in this dress.. This is not happening.. So, different devotees have fascinations. for different qualities,. different behaviours,. different personalities.. So, in order to be available. for every human being of humanity,. the same God is wearing different dresses. and since he has the maya power,. he is becoming also a several persons. wearing different clothes.. Now you choose,. if you like the personality,. you choose that personality.. If you like the dress,. you choose that person wearing dress.. To cater the likings of all the devotees,. God has become several.. Ekaṁ santviprāṁ bhūdhā vadhan.. So that is for the facility of the devotees.. The Hinduism. is the best example. which looks to cater the likings. of all the devotees.. It suits God as per your liking.. It doesn't force your liking to the God.. Because in devotion,. force should not be there.. Full freedom must be there.. So, the whole body should be there.. Full freedom must be there.. Truth always shines in freedom,. not in force.. Okay?. Yes, Swami.. One more question is there, shall I ask Swami?. Okay, Swami.. This question is from Mrs. Suganya Raman.. Pāda namaskar, Swamiji.. In Viṣṇu Sahasranāmam,. there is a verse when Parvati Devi. asked about how scholars can chant. the whole Nāmāvalī without fail.. Īśvara answers,. Śrī Rāma Rāma Rāmeti,. mentioning that the name Rāma. is equivalent to thousand names of Viṣṇu. and it can be chanted.. My question is,. when Lord Kṛṣṇa was there at that time. as contemporary human incarnation. when Viṣṇu Sahasranāmā was given,. why the previous or past incarnation. Lord Rāma was mentioned by Īśvara. at your lotus feet,. your servant Suganya Rāma?. Yes.. Here,. when Īśvara said Śrī Rāma Rāma Rāmeti,. he told,. God Śiva told,. the name of Rāma. not in the view of. the son of Dasaratha,. he told,. he took the word Rāma. in its real sense.. What is the meaning of Rāma?. Rāmate iti Rāma,. Rāmayati iti Rāma.. He who. entertains himself is Rāma.. He who entertains others is Rāma.. These are the meanings of the word Rāma, word.. That indicates the root God and the root story.. Why all this creation came?. Only for entertainment.. Not only his self-entertainment,. he created such a source. in order to entertain them also. he created the world.. To pacify his hunger. and to pacify the hunger of the family members.. So the word Rāma there denotes. the root sense of the God.. Why God created this world. and making all this confusion and all this?. For that the word Rāma answers.. Rāma means. he who entertains himself. Rāmate iti Rāma,. Rāmayati bhaktan swajana iti Rāma.. He who entertains his devotees. is Rāma.. In that sense. when God is taken. all the other thousand names of Vishnu, God. mean different activities of God.. And what is the source of all those. thousand different activities of God?. This entertainment only.. Entertainment is the root. for all the actions of God.. There is no other purpose. of any action of God. except entertainment.. We do several activities. one activity to do job. and to fill our stomach. different purposes. but for God. any activity of God. has only one purpose. that is to entertain.. To entertain himself. and to entertain his devotees. also simultaneously.. Devotees are also entertained.. So that is the root. the root essence of. the all the activities of God. all the activities means. all the names of God.. So the root essence of all the names of God. must be Rāma only.. There even Kṛṣṇa doing. any activity contemporary. is only Rāma.. In fact than Rāma. Kṛṣṇa is more entertained. by his so many lilas.. So the son of Dasaratha. Rāma is not actual Rāma. Kṛṣṇa is Rāma. actual Rāma.. You know the meaning of the word Rāma. you will find that is why. God Śiva told. that sentence.. Okay?. Yes Swami. In Bhakti Sāhitya also. many of the gurus. worldly gurus. took Rāma Shabda. as a substitute for God. not for Dasaratha Putra Rāma. like Kabirdas. and all other Jnana Shri Ishaaka devotee. right Kabir. The Tharaka Mantra is Rāma. Tharaka Mantra they say. Tharaka Mantram. Kūrīna durake nu. Tūnyudanai tīni. Kūrannā. Tharaka Mantram. Tharaka Mantram means. that which. makes you to cross this world. this. pain suffering of the world. that is. if you take that. essence of Rāma in you also. suppose you feel everything as. entertainment. no pain. no suffering. let anything happen. entertain. yourself. where is the sorrow?. See world is going. on its own lines. by. paining yourself by suffering. that is not going to change. instead of. paining. if you entertain. the world will go anyway. constantly like that only. you are. relieved from sorrow and pain. that is called. Moksha. that is the liberation. what is liberation? Liberation from sorrow. liberation from suffering. liberation from pain. everything. is according to you. the. deeds, your deeds. every suffering is according. to your deeds. they are inevitable. when they are inevitable enjoy. there is a saying. when great is inevitable enjoy it. when the karma phalas. when the. fruits of the deeds done in the past. either in the past life. or in the past births. you have to undergo the. fruits. whether good fruits or bad fruits. they are inevitable. when they are inevitable why do you suffer?. you enjoy. by suffering. yourself by getting. pain they are not going to be. avoided. they are inevitable. that is what is. called as Nithyanandaha. always blissful. Akhanda Satchidananda Surupa. the ananda the bliss. what is the. difference between happiness and. bliss you know?. some people think. bliss is very large. thing. happiness is small thing. that is what they think. that is not correct. Anandaha means. the upasarga. samantatandatiti anandaha. that is continuously happiness is. bliss. happiness is 10 units. bliss is 1000 units. it is wrong. what is bliss? what is ananda?. a samantat. continuously. nandati happy is. ananda. you should not have a break in the happiness. you should be continuously happy. when it will happen?. when you are. not attached to the fruits. of the deeds. and you are continuously happy. that is ananda. that is bliss. it is not in the quantity of happiness. it is the continuity of happiness. I have told this. in jnana also. so that continuous happiness is bliss. ananda. a samantat means kala vachaka. that relates to time. not parimana. not the quantity. because happiness. if it grows in its intensity. quantity the fellow will die. every human being. cannot enjoy happiness. beyond certain limits. 100 units have happiness. anybody can withstand. if it crosses more than 100 units. the heart will stop and he will die. so that quantity has limitation. so ananda does not mean. the increased happiness. increased happiness means. he will go up. it is not increased. a samantat nandati. a samantat means always. always happy. not more. more than that. not more. I am happy more than all of you. that is not the meaning. continuous happiness. never you feel sorrow. or anything. let anything happen. you must have heard this story. one minister. anything happens. he was telling. everything is good. everything is good for us. then one day the king's finger was cut. he told the minister. everything is good for us. then the king became angry. and put him in the prison. then he went to. forest for hunting. then he was caught by some. forest fellows. they want to give him sacrifice to. Kali. they took him the king there. then the guru there observed. his finger is not there. anybody given as bali to Kali. must have all parts of the body. since he is not. having the finger they left him. he returned back. released the minister. fell on his feet. what you told is correct. when Sita was. stolen by Ravana. Rama was weeping like anything. then. he was going to. ashram. one sage asked. your god Narayana. why you are weeping. he told. Rama means Ramatriya Rama. he who is entertained is Rama. I am entertained in my weeping. because you see. when you eat haunt dishes. then also you are entertained. not only sweet dishes. I am entertained in the weeping. who said that I am unhappy. I am entertained in the weeping. who said that I am unhappy. who is my incarnation. he who is happy. always. without a trace of. pain, suffering, sorrow. he is my incarnation. he is my real incarnation. bhakti ganga. my true vichanam na sachya gunam. vichanam na sachya gunam. vichanam na sachya gunam. adhigala jivude. navataram. my true. identity. how much time is it. 6.30. coffee is. green tea. Swami. one question. is there Swami. this question is. from Sai Sri Nivas. from Mumbai. Padanamaskaram Swami. how can we encounter. the controversies. on your previous incarnations. you see.
