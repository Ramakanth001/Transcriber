9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:09
 Today we are celebrating Datta Jayanti and Swamiji today's message in Datta Jayanti's message

10
00:01:09 --> 00:01:18
 he explained about Lord Datta and Datta means that who donate himself to the world is Lord Datta

11
00:01:18 --> 00:01:28
 and our Swah, Swah he incarnate in every generation and we are so lucky that we are in this incarnation

12
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
 and we are in this contemporary incarnation with us

13
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
 this is Dattaswami why he was so special about other incarnate

14
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
 Datta means that he donated himself to all the forms

15
00:01:42 --> 00:01:47
 he donated to all the people to entire the world

16
00:01:47 --> 00:01:55
 how he donate himself, how to identify him, after identifying what to do, how to serve him

17
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
 that is the most important aspect and that is Triputti

18
00:02:00 --> 00:02:05
 that is what Swamiji in the name itself in this unique incarnation name itself is Dattaswami

19
00:02:05 --> 00:02:10
 Datta he donate for our contemporary times not the past incarnations

20
00:02:10 --> 00:02:15
 Sripaya Sivallabha, Nishamasarvaswati, Swami Samardha so many past incarnations are there

21
00:02:15 --> 00:02:22
 but still incarnation means the avatara because he come down to the unimaginable state to the imaginable state

22
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
 identifying him, how to identify him, he gives the knowledge

23
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
 by his knowledge he attracts the people

24
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
 tamjnana mohinya avatara mekam

25
00:02:32 --> 00:02:37
 Mohini avatara we know that he attracts so many people by his beauty

26
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
 Dattaswami's beauty is by his knowledge he attracts all the people

27
00:02:42 --> 00:02:48
 so he attracts the people and gives the excellent spiritual knowledge, true spiritual knowledge to the world

28
00:02:48 --> 00:02:56
 that is his primary, always incarnations comes only primary duty to give the knowledge, he is the Satguru

29
00:02:56 --> 00:03:01
 Datta means that is the incarnation who donate for us

30
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
 what is the meaning of Swami?

31
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
 Swami complete and we have to surrender to him

32
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
 the whom we completely surrender to God

33
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
 to whom we completely surrender to our contemporary human incarnation

34
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
 he is Dattaswami

35
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
 he donated for us as well as after that what we have to do?

36
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
 we have to surrender completely and serve him

37
00:03:24 --> 00:03:31
 that is the union that in this incarnation he gives excellent spiritual knowledge

38
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
 in Swami's name was Krishna also he came in the form of Krishna

39
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
 Krishna means karshigeet Krishna

40
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
 he attracts that jnana mohinya

41
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
 mohinya means with his knowledge he attracts everybody

42
00:03:44 --> 00:03:50
 within this incarnation so unique that he is giving excellent spiritual knowledge

43
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
 preaching excellent spiritual knowledge to the entire world

44
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
 not only that after identifying him we have to completely surrender

45
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
 not only surrender we have to completely sacrifice

46
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
 then this complete Dattaswami is complete then only it will complete

47
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
 that is the unique incarnation is with us

48
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
 and whenever Swami incarnates in this human form

49
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
 or energetic form whenever he incarnates every day is the Dattajayanti

50
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
 and whenever he gives the discourse

51
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
 that a new discourse comes new angle comes

52
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
 every day is Dattayanti

53
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
 specially we are celebrating that is what Swami also mentioned in Dattajayanti message

54
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
 he doesn't have any birth he is unimaginable God

55
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
 but he will come down to imagine we have to identify him

56
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
 be with him and live with him and get knowledge from him

57
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
 for giving that four bhakyatvata four fortunes

58
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
 that is why he comes down

59
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48
 we are so fortunate that we are with such a human incarnation

60
00:04:48 --> 00:04:53
 this kind of knowledge never be in the past never be in the future

61
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
 why it is never be in the future?

62
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
 because kami is completely revealed everything

63
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
 nothing is left over

64
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
 that is why we are so blessed

65
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
 living with him and giving opportunity for all of us

66
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
 and thank you for Swami

67
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
 giving this great opportunity for entire mankind

68
00:05:11 --> 00:05:16
 and I will beg you to give your knowledge

69
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
 and remove our ignorance Swami

70
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
 thank you

71
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
 anybody wants to ask any questions?

72
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
 they can ask Swami ji give you answers

73
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
 any questions from anywhere even online people also can

74
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
 unmute themselves and they can ask

75
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
 and Swami you explained in Dattajayanti message

76
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
 and we have God Datta and Dattatreya

77
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
 can you differentiate between God Datta and Dattatreya?

78
00:05:54 --> 00:05:59
 I have already explained in the message

79
00:05:59 --> 00:06:03
 I have already given that answer

80
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
 Swami once more we want to hear from you directly

81
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
 generally many people mistake

82
00:06:13 --> 00:06:21
 that Datta came from Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva

83
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva

84
00:06:28 --> 00:06:33
 those three forms, divine forms

85
00:06:33 --> 00:06:38
 united and became God Datta

86
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
 it is not correct

87
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
 because Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva united

88
00:06:49 --> 00:06:59
 when Anasuya turned them into small children

89
00:06:59 --> 00:07:05
 and then Anasuya asked

90
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
 the three divine forms

91
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
 God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva

92
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
 to be born as her children

93
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
 then Brahma is born as Chandra

94
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
 Vishnu is born as Dattatreya

95
00:07:26 --> 00:07:31
 and Shiva is born as Durvasa

96
00:07:31 --> 00:07:38
 then those three children united

97
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
 to form God Dattatreya

98
00:07:44 --> 00:07:49
 so this story tells us

99
00:07:49 --> 00:07:55
 that God Dattatreya came from

100
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
 God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva

101
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
 this story is correct

102
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
 but before this story

103
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
 there is another story

104
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
 which is in Bhagavatam

105
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
 Shrimad Bhagavatam

106
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
 written by Sage Vyasa

107
00:08:27 --> 00:08:35
 the story before this story was

108
00:08:35 --> 00:08:40
 Sage Atri and other sages

109
00:08:40 --> 00:08:47
 while doing spiritual discussion

110
00:08:47 --> 00:08:52
 developed a big doubt

111
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
 the doubt is

112
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
 we are going to Brahma Loka

113
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
 we are seeing the creator Brahma

114
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
 we are going to Vishnu Loka

115
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
 seeing the creator Vishnu

116
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
 we are going to Siva Loka

117
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
 seeing the destroyer God Shiva

118
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
 separately

119
00:09:21 --> 00:09:26
 these three exist

120
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
 in three separate worlds

121
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
 separately

122
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
 there are three Gods

123
00:09:37 --> 00:09:42
 Creator God, God Brahma

124
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
 Roller God, God Vishnu

125
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
 Destroyer God, God Shiva

126
00:09:48 --> 00:09:53
 when there are three Gods

127
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
 one God for creation

128
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
 one God for ruling

129
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
 and one God for destruction

130
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
 how Veda said

131
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
 that God is only one

132
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
 and that one God is doing

133
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
 creation, ruling and destruction

134
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
 Veda says

135
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
 Eka Meva Advitiya Brahma

136
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
 there is only one God

137
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
 that one God

138
00:10:31 --> 00:10:37
 is creating, ruling and destroying the world

139
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
 Kito Va Imani Bhutani Jayanti

140
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
 Ena Jatani Jeevanti

141
00:10:44 --> 00:10:49
 Yat Prayanch Abhisami Vishanti

142
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
 what we are seeing

143
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
 is just opposing

144
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
 the Vedic concept, Vedic statement

145
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
 Veda says God is one

146
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
 but we are seeing three Gods

147
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
 God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva separately

148
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
 Veda says that

149
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
 the one God

150
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
 is doing all the three cosmic activities

151
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
 creation, ruling and destruction

152
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
 but we are seeing

153
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
 God Brahma doing creation

154
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
 God Vishnu doing ruling

155
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
 and God Shiva doing destruction

156
00:11:36 --> 00:11:40
 our perceptional experience

157
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
 is contradicting the Vedic statement

158
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
 this doubt, this contradiction

159
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
 doubt came to all the sages

160
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
 including Sage Atri

161
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
 Sage Atri along with his wife Anasuya

162
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
 and with all other sages

163
00:12:05 --> 00:12:10
 did long penance

164
00:12:10 --> 00:12:15
 on the mountain called Ruchha

165
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
 Ruchha Parvata

166
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
 to clarify this doubt

167
00:12:24 --> 00:12:29
 then after long penance

168
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
 the three divine forms appeared

169
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
 God Brahma, God Vishnu and God Shiva

170
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
 all the three appeared

171
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
 and told

172
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
 you can treat

173
00:12:46 --> 00:12:51
 that all three of us as one God

174
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
 and we are doing

175
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
 all the three activities creation, ruling and destruction

176
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
 of the world

177
00:13:01 --> 00:13:06
 but Sage Atri did not agree

178
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
 he denied three, A, three

179
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
 three means three, A means no

180
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
 no three, the actual God is only one

181
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
 actual three Gods are not there

182
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
 like that Atri denied

183
00:13:28 --> 00:13:33
 that is why he became Atri

184
00:13:33 --> 00:13:38
 then these three united

185
00:13:38 --> 00:13:43
 and appeared as the original God Datta

186
00:13:43 --> 00:13:50
 what is the story of the original God Datta?

187
00:13:50 --> 00:13:55
 who is the ultimate God?

188
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
 Veda itself says that the ultimate God

189
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
 is the ultimate God

190
00:14:03 --> 00:14:08
 Veda itself says that the ultimate God

191
00:14:08 --> 00:14:13
 is not understood even by intelligence

192
00:14:13 --> 00:14:18
 that is why he is called as unimaginable God

193
00:14:18 --> 00:14:23
 by name Parabrahman

194
00:14:23 --> 00:14:28
 Parabrahman or unimaginable God

195
00:14:28 --> 00:14:34
 cannot be imagined even by intelligence

196
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
 that is why regarding Parabrahman

197
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
 what is the expression?

198
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
 silence is the expression

199
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
 because you cannot imagine

200
00:14:51 --> 00:14:53
 that is what Shankara told

201
00:14:53 --> 00:14:58
 the original God, the ultimate God, the Parabrahman

202
00:14:58 --> 00:15:03
 is represented by silence

203
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
 because the God is unimaginable

204
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
 you cannot imagine

205
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
 then you cannot imagine how can you think

206
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
 how can you speak about it

207
00:15:16 --> 00:15:21
 so therefore the Parabrahman is not imagined

208
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
 you cannot think about it

209
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
 so therefore silence

210
00:15:28 --> 00:15:33
 so this original God

211
00:15:33 --> 00:15:38
 Ekaki Naramate

212
00:15:38 --> 00:15:43
 since he was only one

213
00:15:43 --> 00:15:48
 he did not get any entertainment

214
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
 he got bored

215
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
 he wanted something second

216
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
 for entertainment

217
00:15:59 --> 00:16:04
 if the second is only again one item

218
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
 he may get bored with it

219
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
 and then he may require third item

220
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
 so here

221
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
 Ekaki Naramate

222
00:16:16 --> 00:16:21
 he wanted a second item for the entertainment

223
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
 but second item means not one item

224
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
 second item is several items

225
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
 plural

226
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
 nanatma

227
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
 neha nanasthi kinchera

228
00:16:35 --> 00:16:39
 so that if one item is boring another item

229
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
 if another item is boring another item

230
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
 so the second means plurality

231
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
 multiplicity

232
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
 second means not one

233
00:16:55 --> 00:16:59
 so therefore that unimaginable God

234
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
 which is beyond imagination

235
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
 of any intelligence

236
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
 that unimaginable God

237
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
 created first some space

238
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
 space was generated from God

239
00:17:15 --> 00:17:20
 Atman Akasha Sambhootaha

240
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
 God created first space

241
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
 that first space

242
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
 created by God

243
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
 for the first time

244
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
 is called Paramayoma

245
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
 Paramayoma means absolute space

246
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
 the first space created by God

247
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
 is called absolute space

248
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
 and space means

249
00:17:54 --> 00:17:58
 inert energy, subtle inert energy

250
00:17:58 --> 00:18:02
 from that subtle energy

251
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
 Parabrahman the unimaginable God

252
00:18:06 --> 00:18:10
 created an energetic body

253
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
 body made of energy

254
00:18:13 --> 00:18:16
 and also a soul

255
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
 in that body

256
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
 soul is always energetic only

257
00:18:23 --> 00:18:27
 even our souls are energetic

258
00:18:27 --> 00:18:31
 because soul means awareness

259
00:18:31 --> 00:18:35
 awareness means nervous energy

260
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
 it is also energy

261
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
 in our case the body is matter

262
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
 materialized body

263
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
 but what Parabrahman created was

264
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
 that body is also energy

265
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
 energetic body with energetic soul

266
00:18:54 --> 00:18:57
 was created by Parabrahman

267
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
 in that the form requires some space

268
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
 for that he created space in the big body

269
00:19:04 --> 00:19:07
 created space in the beginning itself

270
00:19:07 --> 00:19:10
 which is called as Paramayoma

271
00:19:10 --> 00:19:17
 so the space occupied by that first energetic body

272
00:19:17 --> 00:19:20
 is called as Paramayoma

273
00:19:20 --> 00:19:24
 or absolute, first absolute space

274
00:19:24 --> 00:19:29
 now

275
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
 why he created this energetic being

276
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
 energetic being means body and soul

277
00:19:36 --> 00:19:39
 human being body and soul

278
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
 why he created that first energetic being

279
00:19:43 --> 00:19:48
 he measured with that energetic being

280
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
 perfectly homogeneously

281
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
 and became

282
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
 that energetic being

283
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
 became Parabrahman

284
00:20:01 --> 00:20:04
 the Parabrahman

285
00:20:04 --> 00:20:07
 measured with that energetic being

286
00:20:07 --> 00:20:13
 so that that energetic being is nothing but Parabrahman

287
00:20:13 --> 00:20:18
 Parabrahman is unimaginable

288
00:20:18 --> 00:20:23
 and this God Datta, this energetic being

289
00:20:23 --> 00:20:27
 with which Parabrahman measured

290
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
 this is called as God Datta

291
00:20:30 --> 00:20:33
 this God Datta is visible

292
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
 that is unimaginable and this is visible

293
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
 there is no difference between unimaginable Parabrahman

294
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
 and visible God Datta

295
00:20:47 --> 00:20:49
 what is the difference?

296
00:20:49 --> 00:20:53
 difference is only medium, energetic medium

297
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
 just like the best simile is

298
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
 a person who is naked in bathroom

299
00:21:00 --> 00:21:03
 not seen by anybody

300
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
 not imagined also by anybody

301
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
 came out with some dress

302
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
 now with the dress

303
00:21:13 --> 00:21:17
 the same person is visible to everybody

304
00:21:17 --> 00:21:24
 there is no difference between that naked person in the bathroom

305
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
 who is not seen by anybody

306
00:21:27 --> 00:21:36
 and the same person who came out of the bathroom with a dress

307
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
 there is no difference between those two

308
00:21:39 --> 00:21:44
 so there is no difference between unimaginable God

309
00:21:44 --> 00:21:46
 called Parabrahman

310
00:21:46 --> 00:21:51
 and the visible energetic form

311
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
 called God Datta

312
00:21:55 --> 00:22:01
 that God Datta appeared

313
00:22:01 --> 00:22:06
 now to Sage Atri and Anasuya

314
00:22:06 --> 00:22:12
 and Sage Atri and Anasuya prayed

315
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
 you please be born to us as our son

316
00:22:18 --> 00:22:27
 and God Datta was born to Sage Datta and Anasuya

317
00:22:27 --> 00:22:35
 since he was born to Sage Atri

318
00:22:35 --> 00:22:40
 he is called as Dattaatreya

319
00:22:40 --> 00:22:44
 Atreya means son of Atri

320
00:22:44 --> 00:22:52
 the same God Datta is born

321
00:22:52 --> 00:22:55
 and who is God Datta?

322
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
 the same unimaginable God

323
00:22:58 --> 00:23:04
 the original unimaginable God is God Datta

324
00:23:04 --> 00:23:11
 and God Datta is born again in human forms

325
00:23:11 --> 00:23:16
 human form called Dattaatreya

326
00:23:16 --> 00:23:22
 actually God, the part of God Brahma

327
00:23:22 --> 00:23:25
 is born as Chandra

328
00:23:25 --> 00:23:31
 part of God Vishnu is born as Dattaatreya

329
00:23:31 --> 00:23:38
 and part of Shiva is born as Durvasa

330
00:23:38 --> 00:23:47
 that this Chandra gave his power

331
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53
 his essence that is God Brahma to Datta

332
00:23:53 --> 00:23:59
 and this Durvasa incarnation of God Shiva

333
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
 he gave his power to this Datta, middle Datta

334
00:24:04 --> 00:24:10
 and this Chandra joined planets

335
00:24:10 --> 00:24:13
 moon is a planet

336
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
 and this Durvasa joined the sages

337
00:24:17 --> 00:24:20
 he is a sage

338
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
 since then this middle Dattaatreya

339
00:24:24 --> 00:24:31
 become the full Datta in human form

340
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
 because Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva

341
00:24:35 --> 00:24:41
 all these three are united in Dattaatreya

342
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
 that God Datta and this Dattaatreya

343
00:24:44 --> 00:24:47
 what is the difference in the form?

344
00:24:47 --> 00:24:51
 that God Datta energetic incarnation

345
00:24:51 --> 00:24:55
 is with three heads and six hands

346
00:24:55 --> 00:25:03
 this Dattaatreya is with one head and two hands

347
00:25:03 --> 00:25:11
 you have got those two forms of photos

348
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
 morning

349
00:25:14 --> 00:25:22
 all of you got two photos from Priyanka

350
00:25:22 --> 00:25:28
 one is three heads and two hands only

351
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
 three heads itself means energetic incarnation

352
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
 energy

353
00:25:36 --> 00:25:42
 only in energy you can have three heads or five heads

354
00:25:42 --> 00:25:47
 but in human form you can have only one head

355
00:25:47 --> 00:25:52
 so

356
00:25:52 --> 00:25:55
 that

357
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
 Trimukha Shatbhujha

358
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
 three faces and six hands is energetic incarnation

359
00:26:03 --> 00:26:13
 in human incarnation you can have only one head and two hands

360
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
 because energy if the material of the body is energy

361
00:26:19 --> 00:26:24
 the energy can take any type of shape

362
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
 but human form cannot take any type of shape

363
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
 only one head and two hands

364
00:26:30 --> 00:26:35
 etc

365
00:26:35 --> 00:26:36
 so

366
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
 God Datta is energetic incarnation

367
00:26:42 --> 00:26:47
 Dattaatreya is human incarnation

368
00:26:47 --> 00:26:51
 and God Datta has no birth

369
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
 since he has no birth

370
00:26:55 --> 00:27:04
 he gave himself as adopted son to Sejatri and Anasuya

371
00:27:04 --> 00:27:06
 Dattaputra

372
00:27:06 --> 00:27:11
 because he has no birth

373
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
 and this Dattaatreya is born to Anasuya

374
00:27:17 --> 00:27:20
 Dattaatreya has birth

375
00:27:20 --> 00:27:23
 now what is this Dattajayanti?

376
00:27:23 --> 00:27:28
 Dattajayanti is the date of birth of God Dattaatreya

377
00:27:28 --> 00:27:32
 who was born to Atri and Anasuya

378
00:27:32 --> 00:27:37
 not the date of birth of that original God Datta

379
00:27:37 --> 00:27:39
 who is Parabrahman

380
00:27:39 --> 00:27:42
 the first in our energetic incarnation

381
00:27:42 --> 00:27:45
 he has no parents

382
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
 he is not born

383
00:27:48 --> 00:27:55
 that God Datta is born to Atri and Anasuya

384
00:27:55 --> 00:28:01
 as human incarnation called Dattaatreya

385
00:28:01 --> 00:28:07
 so this Dattajayanti that is Marga Shersa

386
00:28:07 --> 00:28:14
 Poornima is the date of birth of God Dattaatreya

387
00:28:14 --> 00:28:19
 why there are two types of incarnations

388
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
 energetic and human incarnations

389
00:28:23 --> 00:28:31
 the energetic incarnation is relevant to energetic beings

390
00:28:31 --> 00:28:41
 in the upper worlds above earth

391
00:28:41 --> 00:28:45
 they are called as energetic worlds

392
00:28:45 --> 00:28:53
 the beings there are energetic body and energetic soul

393
00:28:53 --> 00:29:01
 for them God Datta is the relevant energetic incarnation

394
00:29:01 --> 00:29:08
 but for earth, this world, this earth

395
00:29:08 --> 00:29:13
 the relevant incarnation is human incarnation

396
00:29:13 --> 00:29:19
 what is the difference between energetic being and human being?

397
00:29:19 --> 00:29:24
 in energetic being the body is made of energy

398
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
 the soul is energy only

399
00:29:27 --> 00:29:31
 human being, the body is human body

400
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
 but the soul is energetic

401
00:29:34 --> 00:29:42
 that is the difference between energetic beings and human beings

402
00:29:42 --> 00:29:47
 so God Dattaatreya is relevant to human beings

403
00:29:47 --> 00:29:56
 and God Datta is relevant to energetic beings in the upper worlds

404
00:29:56 --> 00:30:00
 when God Parabrahman made the
