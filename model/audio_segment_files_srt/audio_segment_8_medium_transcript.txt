You are getting punya. It is not a sin.. So the fruit is depending on the intention only.. Same Arjuna, same Bhishma, same killing of Bhishma.. In both sin is same, but intention differs.. That was what Krishna told.. Can intention be changed by devotion?. Means when devotion improves, you reach that stage.. That is what, because of devotee, as a devotee only, his intention is changed, is it not?. Because Arjuna is a devotee of Krishna, his intention is changed and he fought the war.. If Arjuna is not a devotee of Krishna, he will not fight.. He will go back due to fascination towards his grandfather.. He has to defeat the worldly bond of grandfather for the sake of God.. That is the test, dharma pariksha is only that.. For my sake, which you can sacrifice?. Fascination to me or fascination to your worldly bond?. If you sacrifice your worldly bond for my sake, then you have won in the test.. If you sacrifice me for the sake of the worldly bond, then you fail in the test.. That is the test of dattas.. The same datta test is performed by Krishna who is datta to Arjuna who is a devotee.. That is only datta pariksha.. What is the time?. 6.40. So you have crossed the time.. But still, any question anybody is having, you can ask.. Swami, this is in context to Ramayana.. When Lord Hanuman, when he travelled to Lanka, he is considered to be a servant of Rama, his servant.. So in this context, I and Abhiram were discussing and we had this question that when he went there, while he was coming back, he burnt the Lanka.. So without the instruction of Rama, he does not do anything.. Without the instruction of Rama, he does not do anything because he is completely surrendered to him.. So can he burn the Lanka, I mean burning the Lanka without the instruction of Rama, did he cross his.... No, instruction means even mental inspiration.. God can speak through mind also.. Is it necessary to speak or to phone him and tell him or send email?. Burn the Lanka, email or phone.. Is it necessary?. Rama could have told in his mind.. God can communicate in any way beyond human ways. Is it not?. So he burned Lanka based on the instruction of Rama. Can we understand from that?. No, you see, you can say like that also.. You can also say since Hanuman is the best devotee of Rama,. in the interest of, in the true context of true love to Rama, he did that for the sake of the benefit of Rama.. If Lanka is burnt, the courage of the demons is finished a lot, you know.. He threatened them. Their courage is reduced. Courage reduced means the strength is reduced.. The war will be easy.. So you can think that from the side of devotee or from the side of God Rama.. Suppose you think that Rama is incapable of sending that Hanuman did not take the permission of Rama,. then we will answer like this.. If you say that no, no, Rama did not give instruction but still he did it in the true love of Rama, in the service of Rama.. Yes, that is correct we will say from the side of the devotee.. Both are correlating. They are not contradicting.. Matta, Pachyavara, Kashi, Nasti, Sugrivas and Nidhavu.. After burning all the Lanka and killing so many demons, he says, I am the weakest monkey.. I am the weakest monkey.. If the weakest monkey has done so much, what will be other monkeys?. What will be the leader of those monkeys, Sugriva?. And what will be the strength of Rama who killed Vali, the greatest monkey?. Like that they will estimate and their courage will come down.. Q. If the previous action was against the action of the previous action, would it be the action of the previous action?. I think what Hrishikesh asked is already answered by Valmiki.. Yes, yes. If nothing in favor of Rama is damaged, that action can be done.. If that does not contradict Rama.. But one place Hanuman, in this sloka, he uttered this sloka in a different context.. That is, when he burned the Lanka, he thought, what foolish thing I did in these flames.. Sita must have been burned. There he tells that sloka.. A person must do an action, new action, which will not spoil the original action.. But what I did, I burned the Lanka, I discouraged all the demons.. That is also correct. Sita might have been burned in these flames.. There he tells that sloka. Yes, in that context he tells that sloka.. That was my next question, Swamy.. Already it is written in Valmiki Ramayana. So, don't come.. Sorry, one last question. Hanuman is considered to be the servant of Rama.. Adi Shesha is considered to be the slave. So, what is the difference between servant and slave?. No, Hanuman is also a slave. Dasa. Dasoham Kosalendra Rasa.. Ramasya Krishnagarmana climbs the wall of Lanka and shouts,. Jayat Chidibalu Rama Lachwanascha Mahabalaha. Raja Jayat Shibhuri Vuraghavir Naapipadita.. Dasoham Kosalendra Rasa. I am the servant of Rama.. Ramasya Krishnagarmana. He is also dasa. Dasa is also a stage of devotion.. Rasa. No, Lachwana is also behaved like that. Dasya, Swamy.. That is what Madhvacharya says.. God is saviour and the devotee is the servant.. That is the relationship between God and devotee. That is what is told by Madhvacharya.. Seviya Sevaka Sammantha. Jeeve Svarayoh.. Swamiji, how is that different from Shesha Shesha Sambandham, Swamiji?. Shesha Shesha Sambandham is Ramanujam. That is with Lachwana.. Dasya, the Seviya Sevaka Sammantha is with Hanuman. That is told by Madhvacharya.. That is why in Madhva Matha Hanuman is very important. Not Lachwana.. Lachwana is important in Ramanujamatha. In fact Ramanujamatha himself is called as Lachwana.. He is Adi Shesha Avatara. Lachwana is also Adi Shesha Avatara.. Shesha Shesha Sammantha means the part and whole.. Sometimes we say, you both are my eyes.. That is the Shesha Shesha Sammantha. Part and whole.. That is introduced by Ramanujamatha.. And the Seviya Sevaka Sammantha is introduced by Manvacharya.. Anything more?. If nothing is there, we will end this session.. Swamiji, last question.. For suppose Ravana, of course Ravana is a villain in that character Rama.. For suppose Ravana, even entire Lanka was made of gold.. With entire gold along with Sita surrendered to Lord Rama.. He might have crossed even like Gopikas and Hanuman or not. Just a question.. If Ravana had surrendered Sita to Lord Rama along with his Lanka, would he have become a devotee then?. I don't understand. You tell me Prasad.. If Ravana had surrendered Sita to Lord Rama along with his Lanka, would he have become a devotee then?. What can I do?. Whatever you ask a question, you ask a question about Ravana.. I will give the answer.. But every time Dick and Harry doing something, how can you ask question to me?. I am not responsible for human beings.. I am only responsible for God.. God is not a human being.. I am not responsible for human beings.. I am only responsible for God.. God in absolute state or God in human form state.. Rama did like this, how? You question, I will ask. I will answer.. Krishna did like this, how? You ask, I will answer.. But Satyartha did like this, how? You cannot ask.. How can I answer? How I am responsible for the human being?. Ravana is a human being.. Ravana is not God.. Ravana is not God.. I am standing on the side of God.. Not on the side of souls.. Souls do several things.. That is as per their samskaras.. As per their qualities.. They have attained in the previous births.. For that I am not.... See, I have come, I am standing only to answer about God.. Not about... You also asked once question.. Why Shantanu did not object when Ganga is dipping the children in the Ganga?. How I am responsible?. Shantanu is not God.. Ganga is not God.. They both are souls.. When souls did something, if you are there in their time, you put a case in the court.. Then the court will punish them.. Israel is fault.. I am not responsible.. I am responsible only for God.. God in human form, God in energetic form.. Their actions.... Why Krishna danced with the Guru? Because you asked me.. I will tell for one day.. Because it is related to God.. Swami, will God be pleased or not if he has done like that?. God will be pleased or not if for suppose he has done like that?. If God is pleased, he would have not killed Ravana.. Rama killed Ravana.. Is it not?. That means God is not pleased.. And to displease God by displeasing God, then only Ravana can become enemy to Rama.. When he became enemy, he can get salvation in three births.. Not as a devotee.. If he behaves like a devotee, Ravana behaves, then he would have taken seven births to reach Vaikuntha.. Definitely he behaved like enemy.. That is why he reached God in three births.. That itself gives the answer logic.. That means if Rama is pleased, Ravana must be a devotee.. Is it not? Ravana cannot be enemy.. If Ravana is not pleased, then only Ravana can be enemy.. As enemy only in three births he will reach. That is the boon, you know, Vara.. That means Ravana behaved like enemy, must behave like enemy, according to the desire by Jaya and Vijaya.. Since he behaved like enemy, Rama is not pleased.. The answer lies there itself.. Okay, Pramodji.. Then the next program, Pramodji.. Swami, I just got one doubt now, Swami.. This is Veena Dutta.. Swami, Jaya and Vijaya might have taken these seven births only, no, Swami.. Then that time also they will be with Lord only as friend.. It is the same Lord here and there also.. No, suppose Jaya and Vijaya have taken seven births as devotees,. then Jaya and Vijaya would have not behaved like Ravana and Kumbhakarna.. Yes, Swami, that is correct.. Yes.. This is not related to the old question, Swami.. Yes, Swami, that is correct.. Yes.. This is not related to the old question, Swami.. But Jaya and Vijaya have chosen to reach Vaikuntha in three births only instead of taking seven births.. Yes.. But they could have also chosen seven births because they will be with the same Lord here also as friend.. But Jaya and Vijaya have chosen three births and not seven births telling the reason that we cannot wait so long time separated from God.. God also will be incarnated in those seven births also, no, Swami.. God has chosen that option to become devotees in seven births.. God would have agreed for that also. God gave two options.. Okay, got it, Swami.. Either in seven births as a devotee or in three births as enemy.. Then Jaya and Vijaya told, we cannot wait such a long time seven births to reach our God.. We will reach you in three births itself as enemies because the separation time is lesser.. Got it, Swami.. So they have chosen to be close in the form of Narayana only.. To be close with Narayana early, as early as possible.. And that is possible only when they become enemies in three births.. Understood.. Understood.. Okay..
