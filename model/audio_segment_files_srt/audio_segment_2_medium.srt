1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
 facilities made an arrangement like this. 
 
2
0:00:05 --> 00:00:09
 Our foolish human beings, they go on doing

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:23
 penance, tapas, to see that energetic form that God Datta. Lifelong penance he did,

3
00:00:23 --> 00:00:32
 God Datta appeared. Then when he will hear the knowledge from him, when he will develop

4
00:00:32 --> 00:00:47
 devotion, when he will serve him to get salvation, where is time? So there is no time, no question

5
00:00:47 --> 00:00:59
 of salvation, problem solved. There is a story, King Bhoja was invited by, you know,

6
00:00:59 --> 00:01:14
 the king, he has several wives. That day there were, with one wife, one night he goes.

7
00:01:14 --> 00:01:22
 That day, one day, from all the seven wives invitations came for him.

8
00:01:22 --> 00:01:29
 So, he was invited.

9
00:01:29 --> 00:01:44
 Kuntala Raja, Raja, his daughter, she has passed that four days menstrual period and

10
00:01:44 --> 00:01:54
 fifth days bath she has taken and invited King Bhoja to come to her house. Another

11
00:01:54 --> 00:02:05
 Magadha Raja Suta, Magadha Raja Putri, with her King Bhoja played chess and when the chess

12
00:02:06 --> 00:02:16
 played the bettino, if Bhoja is defeated, he should come to her that night. So according

13
00:02:16 --> 00:02:27
 to that, he has to go to the Antapura of Magadha Raja Putri. Then Kaushala Raja Putri, she

14
00:02:27 --> 00:02:36
 has done Satcharana and Swami Vratam and invited King Bhoja to come to her house. Like that,

15
00:02:36 --> 00:02:46
 every wife send invitation. King Bhoja was sitting, to whose house I should go? To whose

16
00:02:46 --> 00:03:01
 house I should go? In this thinking, in this diorama, the night has gone. The morning came,

17
00:03:01 --> 00:03:18
 problem is solved. No need of salvation. I am doing penance to see God. When the energetic

18
00:03:18 --> 00:03:26
 incarnation appears, it is irrelevant incarnation. It is not in the arrangement of God. God's

19
00:03:26 --> 00:03:34
 arrangement is human incarnation for humanity. This fellow did penance through all the life

20
00:03:34 --> 00:03:43
 to see God Datta. He saw God Datta. The life finished. No need of sadhana because life

21
00:03:43 --> 00:03:56
 finished. Like Bhoja has night finished. Problem solved. See, he should see God to learn the

22
00:03:56 --> 00:04:03
 true spiritual knowledge. Then after hearing true spiritual knowledge, he must develop

23
00:04:03 --> 00:04:14
 devotion on God. Then after developing devotion, he must serve God, then please God, then

24
00:04:14 --> 00:04:25
 get the salvation. To hear the true knowledge, you must see God. That is the first step.

25
00:04:26 --> 00:04:37
 For that itself, the whole life has gone. Is it not foolishness of human beings? How

26
00:04:37 --> 00:04:46
 beautiful arrangement God made. He came in human form to preach the true spiritual knowledge

27
00:04:46 --> 00:04:53
 so that you can develop devotion, you can serve God, you can please God, and finally

28
00:04:53 --> 00:05:08
 you get the ultimate salvation. There is lot of time is there. Lifetime is there. So, energetic

29
00:05:08 --> 00:05:15
 incarnation is also same God. Human incarnation is also same God. I am not denying energetic

30
00:05:15 --> 00:05:22
 incarnation. Energetic incarnation is relevant to upper energetic beings. For them he speeches

31
00:05:24 --> 00:05:41
 true spiritual knowledge. That is why God Datta confined to upper energetic worlds only

32
00:05:42 --> 00:06:03
 and God Datta is confined to this earth, humanity. And you may say, human being is he God? I

33
00:06:04 --> 00:06:11
 will ask one simple question all of you. Rama is God or not? Krishna is God or not? Are

34
00:06:13 --> 00:06:26
 they not human beings? They are God. You have problem with Sripada Vallabha, Narasimha Saraswati,

35
00:06:27 --> 00:06:34
 Manikya Prabhu, Akalakota Maharaj, Sri Sai Baba, Satcha Sai Baba, Prave Sai Baba, like

36
00:06:34 --> 00:06:45
 this. And in Gita it is clearly told, Avajananti Ma Mudhaah, Manushim Tanumashridham. When

37
00:06:46 --> 00:06:57
 I come in human form, these human beings unable to recognize me, insult me. Bhagavad Gita

38
00:06:57 --> 00:07:06
 Shloka is there. When I come in human form, Manushim Tanumashridham. Scriptural authority

39
00:07:07 --> 00:07:14
 is there. Then why should you doubt? What is the basis of your doubt? You agree Rama

40
00:07:19 --> 00:07:26
 and Krishna as human incarnations. You believe in Bhagavad Gita and that Bhagavad Gita is

41
00:07:27 --> 00:07:34
 also told by human incarnation. And you believe in Bhagavad Gita. And Bhagavad Gita is also

42
00:07:36 --> 00:07:43
 told by human incarnation. Since he is the human incarnation, he told like that. Then

43
00:07:47 --> 00:07:54
 nobody can save you. Nobody can save you. So, the reason why I am telling you this is

44
00:08:06 --> 00:08:13
 the message of Datta Jayanthi which I gave in the morning. Any questions and answers?

45
00:08:20 --> 00:08:27
 Anybody ask a question? I am Purnima Swami. So, can a newly married couple aspire to have

46
00:08:27 --> 00:08:34
 God Datta as their son? If yes, can they aspire? If yes, what is it that they need

47
00:08:46 --> 00:08:53
 to do Swami? You see, before an aspirant can aspire to have God Datta as their son, they

48
00:08:57 --> 00:09:04
 must understand one problem. If they aspire God Datta as their son, they must give a

49
00:09:12 --> 00:09:19
 share of their property to son. If they agree for this, they must give a share of their

50
00:09:27 --> 00:09:34
 property. Later on they may get some sons. But if you take one adopted son, you must

51
00:09:34 --> 00:09:41
 at least give a share of the property along with the born sons. At least share, equal

52
00:09:41 --> 00:09:48
 share. So, if they are prepared to give a share of property and if he is born, he will

53
00:09:57 --> 00:10:04
 be given a share of the property. If he is born, he will be given a share of the property.

54
00:10:05 --> 00:10:12
 That is why he is not Datta. Datta means adopted. That is why he gave to Atri and Anasuya also

55
00:10:16 --> 00:10:23
 as adopted son. That is why he is called as Datta. Dattoham. When they asked him to become

56
00:10:23 --> 00:10:30
 adopted, he said, I will give him a share of the property. So, when adoption is given,

57
00:10:30 --> 00:10:37
 the original real parents must be there to give the son for adoption. Adoption is a ritual.

58
00:10:39 --> 00:10:46
 You want to take a son, there is a Datta homam. There is a ritual. And in that ritual, that

59
00:10:47 --> 00:10:54
 boy must be given by his parents, his biological parents must give that son to this parents.

60
00:11:01 --> 00:11:08
 That is called as Datta. Genuinely he is Datta. For that he has no parents, no biological

61
00:11:08 --> 00:11:15
 parents. So, he himself gave himself as adopted son. So, he is not adopted. He is adopted.

62
00:11:16 --> 00:11:23
 He is adopted son to Atri and Anasuya. Dattoham asmi, Dattoham asmi, Dattoham asmi. He told

63
00:11:24 --> 00:11:31
 thrice. That is why he is called as Datta. That is also one reason. Another reason is

64
00:11:34 --> 00:11:41
 he is given to the world of souls for worship and meditation. That is one meaning. Another

65
00:11:41 --> 00:11:48
 meaning is when Atri and Anasuya asked him to become their son, then he told, how can

66
00:11:54 --> 00:12:01
 I become your son? My biological parents must be there. They must give me to you through

67
00:12:03 --> 00:12:10
 this Datta homam ritual. They are not there. Therefore, I am myself giving myself to the

68
00:12:11 --> 00:12:18
 world as your adopted son. He told thrice. Dattoham asmi, Dattoham asmi, Dattoham asmi.

69
00:12:19 --> 00:12:26
 Then he became the adopted son to Atri and Anasuya. Otherwise he is not Datta. So, that

70
00:12:26 --> 00:12:33
 is why understanding this problem, all the devotees reversed the policy. We are your

71
00:12:33 --> 00:12:40
 children. You are our parents. If you are not there, then you are not our father. If

72
00:13:03 --> 00:13:10
 you have some property, give to us. Our human beings are very, very intelligent. Very intelligent.

73
00:13:17 --> 00:13:24
 Today I was very happy, extremely happy with one devotee. One devotee phoned to me and

74
00:13:24 --> 00:13:31
 told, I want to use some of my gold to you because you are our Datta putra, adopted son.

75
00:13:47 --> 00:13:54
 Sudharani, mother of Trilokya. I am very happy with you. I am very happy with you. I am very

76
00:13:54 --> 00:14:01
 happy with you. I was wondering, I think she is the real devotee. Because all other devotees

77
00:14:06 --> 00:14:13
 phoned and told, we are your children. I also arranged some good finance fund so that you

78
00:14:13 --> 00:14:20
 can take your shares. I felt when she phoned to me and told, I want to use some of my gold

79
00:14:20 --> 00:14:27
 because you are our Datta putra. Then I told, I am myself the adopted son of Trilokya.

80
00:14:51 --> 00:14:58
 24 carats gold. Why you are thinking to give 22 carats gold? Moreover, you say that I am

81
00:15:03 --> 00:15:10
 son. I am not daughter. Only to daughter gold is given. Not son. I told all that and she

82
00:15:10 --> 00:15:17
 brought that jewel. Seeing that jewel, I feared it so much stout. It was just like

83
00:15:28 --> 00:15:35
 Ajagara snake. No, what you call? Phython. Phython type. So I asked her, what is the

84
00:15:40 --> 00:15:47
 difference between the two? She said, I am afraid of phython. You put in the bag. I will

85
00:15:54 --> 00:16:01
 take home like one devotee in the time of Akalakot Maharaj. He shows some snakes. You

86
00:16:01 --> 00:16:08
 take Ajmini snakes? You want? He is afraid. Then Maharaj says, no, you take. I am ordering

87
00:16:19 --> 00:16:26
 you. Then somehow with lot of reluctance, he caught fear. He caught snake and rounded

88
00:16:31 --> 00:16:38
 it with a towel. He took it to his home. During the journey, he was shivering. He said, see

89
00:16:43 --> 00:16:50
 when it will bite. When he took it to his house, he opened and it was golden snake.

90
00:16:50 --> 00:16:57
 He was very poor person. Swami wanted to bless him. He wanted to remove his poverty. So

91
00:17:07 --> 00:17:14
 now this phython I am taking home. I am not as deserving as that devotee. So what will

92
00:17:14 --> 00:17:21
 happen? This gold chain will become phython. When I take home and open the box, here the

93
00:17:32 --> 00:17:39
 snake became gold chain. Now this, since I am not as deserving as that devotee, when

94
00:17:40 --> 00:17:47
 I take this golden chain to my house, it will become phython. So your question need not

95
00:18:01 --> 00:18:08
 be answered because nobody will aspire.

96
00:18:09 --> 00:18:16
 So there is no problem with your question. The case is disposed with no costs. So you

97
00:18:39 --> 00:18:46
 can ask any question. Then again any other question? You translate it in English. I will

98
00:18:58 --> 00:19:05
 translate it in English. You ask in Telugu. My name is Ramasundari. My name is Ramasundari.

99
00:19:09 --> 00:19:14
 My name is Ramasundari.

100
00:19:39 --> 00:20:07
 The translation of this question is that when God Shiva could excuse Daksha by giving life

101
00:20:07 --> 00:20:19
 and by giving a new face to him, when God Shiva is so kind in the case of Daksha, why

102
00:20:19 --> 00:20:34
 he is not kind in the case of Sati? When she burnt herself, why God Shiva did not save

103
00:20:34 --> 00:20:49
 her? Such a kind Lord Shiva. That is her question. There are some differences between Sati and

104
00:20:49 --> 00:21:08
 Daksha. Sati committed suicide. Daksha was killed. There is one difference. Sati was the

105
00:21:08 --> 00:21:17
 highest devotee of God Shiva and Daksha was the highest enemy of God Shiva. That is another

106
00:21:17 --> 00:21:31
 difference. Being the highest devotee, when God Shiva advised her not to go to her father's house,

107
00:21:31 --> 00:21:46
 she neglected that word and went to the house of her father. If Daksha refused the word of Shiva,

108
00:21:46 --> 00:21:56
 there is no surprise. He is the enemy. But being the highest devotee, climax devotee,

109
00:21:59 --> 00:22:01
 in the language of Bhanu Samayikya,

110
00:22:01 --> 00:22:17
 being the climax devotee, she did not listen to the advice of God Shiva.

111
00:22:19 --> 00:22:31
 That is the greatest sin. If a non-believer is rejecting God, that is not a very big sin.

112
00:22:32 --> 00:22:42
 As per his nature, he did not listen. There is no surprise. There is no wonder. But Sati being

113
00:22:42 --> 00:22:53
 so such a devoted soul, why she rejected the advice of God Shiva and went to her father's house?

114
00:22:54 --> 00:23:04
 When God Shiva advised, it means it is not good for her to go to her father's house.

115
00:23:06 --> 00:23:12
 Why she did not think, why she did not analyze that much?

116
00:23:13 --> 00:23:22
 Daksha can be excused because he is already enemy. But Sati cannot be excused

117
00:23:25 --> 00:23:33
 being the climax devotee. Now finally what Bhanu Samayikya told is correct.

118
00:23:33 --> 00:23:40
 That is God Shiva and Sati, they acted their drama.

119
00:23:48 --> 00:23:56
 Why they acted now? Why I am not accepting it?

120
00:23:56 --> 00:24:06
 Why they acted now? Why I am appreciating that word drama? Because

121
00:24:07 --> 00:24:11
 God and climax devotees act drama

122
00:24:14 --> 00:24:21
 so that there will be a lesson to be learned by the human beings.

123
00:24:21 --> 00:24:30
 They acted drama, that is correct. But for what purpose they acted drama? Not for their purpose.

124
00:24:32 --> 00:24:44
 For the sake of the world, to know some lesson, to know some divine concept, they acted drama.

125
00:24:45 --> 00:24:46
 They acted drama.

126
00:24:49 --> 00:24:54
 So you should correct yourself. They acted their dramas, why should we bother about them?

127
00:24:55 --> 00:24:57
 For your sake only they are acting the drama.

128
00:25:04 --> 00:25:13
 You are the audience, they are actors. For whose sake drama is played? For the sake of audience.

129
00:25:15 --> 00:25:17
 So you got the answer?

130
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
 Any other question?

131
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
 During that process of drama, right Swami, to show us all, to show the audience,

132
00:25:35 --> 00:25:37
 there will be also suffering, no Swami.

133
00:25:37 --> 00:25:38
 There will be?

134
00:25:38 --> 00:25:38
 Suffering.

135
00:25:38 --> 00:25:40
 Suffering, actors.

136
00:25:40 --> 00:25:45
 Actors. See actors means they are acting suffering.

137
00:25:51 --> 00:25:58
 Audience only suffer. When they see cinema, they weep.

138
00:26:01 --> 00:26:03
 But the actors put a glycerin for weeping.

139
00:26:10 --> 00:26:16
 Yes, anybody else?

140
00:26:23 --> 00:26:27
 Swami, is avyaktam and sadasat, both are same Swami?

141
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
 Are avyaktam and sadasat both same or are they different?

142
00:26:32 --> 00:26:37
 You see, avyaktam is sat.

143
00:26:40 --> 00:26:47
 Sadasat means existing, non-existing. That is the contradiction.

144
00:26:49 --> 00:26:54
 Either one thing should exist or should not exist. Is it not?

145
00:26:54 --> 00:27:18
 Sadasat, the sadasat itself is a contradiction.

146
00:27:18 --> 00:27:32
 It cannot be both sat and asat. You cannot say that this light is existing and also not existing.

147
00:27:38 --> 00:27:44
 He told in Gita, I am both sat and asat.

148
00:27:45 --> 00:27:50
 There that is different because he is omnipotent.

149
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
 He told about himself. God told about himself.

150
00:28:01 --> 00:28:10
 There, if you analyze, that is also collaborated. How?

151
00:28:15 --> 00:28:24
 When God enters a human being and merges with him completely to become human incarnation,

152
00:28:27 --> 00:28:32
 I remain as God component. That is sat.

153
00:28:34 --> 00:28:41
 At the same time, I also become asat. What is asat here? That human being.

154
00:28:41 --> 00:28:50
 Human being is a part of the world. World is inherently non-existent.

155
00:28:54 --> 00:29:03
 So, that human being is taken as asat. By homogeneous merging with the human being component,

156
00:29:03 --> 00:29:08
 the human being component also becomes God.

157
00:29:10 --> 00:29:16
 God remains as God component. God also became the human being component.

158
00:29:18 --> 00:29:30
 So, there I am both God component as well as the human being component because of the homogeneous merging.

159
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
 There when you analyze, it becomes correct.

160
00:29:37 --> 00:29:39
 When the fire enters the iron rod,

161
00:29:42 --> 00:29:47
 the fire is as fire is there, the iron rod also becomes fire.

162
00:29:51 --> 00:29:55
 So, I remain as sat. I also become the asat.

163
00:29:55 --> 00:29:59
 There is no difference between the human being and the asat.
