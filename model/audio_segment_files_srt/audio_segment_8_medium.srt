1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
 You are getting punya. It is not a sin.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:09
 So the fruit is depending on the intention only.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:15
 Same Arjuna, same Bhishma, same killing of Bhishma.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
 In both sin is same, but intention differs.

5
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
 That was what Krishna told.

6
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
 Can intention be changed by devotion?

7
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
 Means when devotion improves, you reach that stage.

8
00:00:35 --> 00:00:42
 That is what, because of devotee, as a devotee only, his intention is changed, is it not?

9
00:00:42 --> 00:00:49
 Because Arjuna is a devotee of Krishna, his intention is changed and he fought the war.

10
00:00:49 --> 00:00:55
 If Arjuna is not a devotee of Krishna, he will not fight.

11
00:00:55 --> 00:01:01
 He will go back due to fascination towards his grandfather.

12
00:01:01 --> 00:01:10
 He has to defeat the worldly bond of grandfather for the sake of God.

13
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
 That is the test, dharma pariksha is only that.

14
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
 For my sake, which you can sacrifice?

15
00:01:20 --> 00:01:25
 Fascination to me or fascination to your worldly bond?

16
00:01:25 --> 00:01:31
 If you sacrifice your worldly bond for my sake, then you have won in the test.

17
00:01:31 --> 00:01:40
 If you sacrifice me for the sake of the worldly bond, then you fail in the test.

18
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
 That is the test of dattas.

19
00:01:43 --> 00:01:53
 The same datta test is performed by Krishna who is datta to Arjuna who is a devotee.

20
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
 That is only datta pariksha.

21
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
 What is the time?

22
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
 6.40

23
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
 So you have crossed the time.

24
00:02:21 --> 00:02:27
 But still, any question anybody is having, you can ask.

25
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
 Swami, this is in context to Ramayana.

26
00:02:34 --> 00:02:42
 When Lord Hanuman, when he travelled to Lanka, he is considered to be a servant of Rama, his servant.

27
00:02:42 --> 00:02:52
 So in this context, I and Abhiram were discussing and we had this question that when he went there, while he was coming back, he burnt the Lanka.

28
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
 So without the instruction of Rama, he does not do anything.

29
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
 Without the instruction of Rama, he does not do anything because he is completely surrendered to him.

30
00:03:02 --> 00:03:11
 So can he burn the Lanka, I mean burning the Lanka without the instruction of Rama, did he cross his...

31
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
 No, instruction means even mental inspiration.

32
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
 God can speak through mind also.

33
00:03:19 --> 00:03:28
 Is it necessary to speak or to phone him and tell him or send email?

34
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
 Burn the Lanka, email or phone.

35
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
 Is it necessary?

36
00:03:36 --> 00:03:40
 Rama could have told in his mind.

37
00:03:40 --> 00:03:50
 God can communicate in any way beyond human ways. Is it not?

38
00:03:50 --> 00:03:56
 So he burned Lanka based on the instruction of Rama. Can we understand from that?

39
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
 No, you see, you can say like that also.

40
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
 You can also say since Hanuman is the best devotee of Rama,

41
00:04:04 --> 00:04:18
 in the interest of, in the true context of true love to Rama, he did that for the sake of the benefit of Rama.

42
00:04:18 --> 00:04:30
 If Lanka is burnt, the courage of the demons is finished a lot, you know.

43
00:04:30 --> 00:04:40
 He threatened them. Their courage is reduced. Courage reduced means the strength is reduced.

44
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
 The war will be easy.

45
00:04:44 --> 00:04:52
 So you can think that from the side of devotee or from the side of God Rama.

46
00:04:52 --> 00:05:01
 Suppose you think that Rama is incapable of sending that Hanuman did not take the permission of Rama,

47
00:05:01 --> 00:05:07
 then we will answer like this.

48
00:05:07 --> 00:05:15
 If you say that no, no, Rama did not give instruction but still he did it in the true love of Rama, in the service of Rama.

49
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
 Yes, that is correct we will say from the side of the devotee.

50
00:05:20 --> 00:05:27
 Both are correlating. They are not contradicting.

51
00:05:27 --> 00:05:33
 Matta, Pachyavara, Kashi, Nasti, Sugrivas and Nidhavu.

52
00:05:33 --> 00:05:42
 After burning all the Lanka and killing so many demons, he says, I am the weakest monkey.

53
00:05:42 --> 00:05:49
 I am the weakest monkey.

54
00:05:49 --> 00:05:56
 If the weakest monkey has done so much, what will be other monkeys?

55
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
 What will be the leader of those monkeys, Sugriva?

56
00:06:00 --> 00:06:09
 And what will be the strength of Rama who killed Vali, the greatest monkey?

57
00:06:09 --> 00:06:14
 Like that they will estimate and their courage will come down.

58
00:06:14 --> 00:06:29
 Q. If the previous action was against the action of the previous action, would it be the action of the previous action?

59
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
 I think what Hrishikesh asked is already answered by Valmiki.

60
00:06:33 --> 00:06:45
 Yes, yes. If nothing in favor of Rama is damaged, that action can be done.

61
00:06:45 --> 00:06:50
 If that does not contradict Rama.

62
00:06:50 --> 00:07:02
 But one place Hanuman, in this sloka, he uttered this sloka in a different context.

63
00:07:02 --> 00:07:11
 That is, when he burned the Lanka, he thought, what foolish thing I did in these flames.

64
00:07:11 --> 00:07:18
 Sita must have been burned. There he tells that sloka.

65
00:07:18 --> 00:07:27
 A person must do an action, new action, which will not spoil the original action.

66
00:07:27 --> 00:07:33
 But what I did, I burned the Lanka, I discouraged all the demons.

67
00:07:33 --> 00:07:38
 That is also correct. Sita might have been burned in these flames.

68
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
 There he tells that sloka. Yes, in that context he tells that sloka.

69
00:07:42 --> 00:07:47
 That was my next question, Swamy.

70
00:07:47 --> 00:07:54
 Already it is written in Valmiki Ramayana. So, don't come.

71
00:07:54 --> 00:08:00
 Sorry, one last question. Hanuman is considered to be the servant of Rama.

72
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
 Adi Shesha is considered to be the slave. So, what is the difference between servant and slave?

73
00:08:06 --> 00:08:14
 No, Hanuman is also a slave. Dasa. Dasoham Kosalendra Rasa.

74
00:08:14 --> 00:08:23
 Ramasya Krishnagarmana climbs the wall of Lanka and shouts,

75
00:08:23 --> 00:08:30
 Jayat Chidibalu Rama Lachwanascha Mahabalaha. Raja Jayat Shibhuri Vuraghavir Naapipadita.

76
00:08:30 --> 00:08:35
 Dasoham Kosalendra Rasa. I am the servant of Rama.

77
00:08:35 --> 00:08:46
 Ramasya Krishnagarmana. He is also dasa. Dasa is also a stage of devotion.

78
00:08:46 --> 00:08:55
 Rasa. No, Lachwana is also behaved like that. Dasya, Swamy.

79
00:08:55 --> 00:09:03
 That is what Madhvacharya says.

80
00:09:03 --> 00:09:11
 God is saviour and the devotee is the servant.

81
00:09:11 --> 00:09:18
 That is the relationship between God and devotee. That is what is told by Madhvacharya.

82
00:09:18 --> 00:09:24
 Seviya Sevaka Sammantha. Jeeve Svarayoh.

83
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
 Swamiji, how is that different from Shesha Shesha Sambandham, Swamiji?

84
00:09:30 --> 00:09:36
 Shesha Shesha Sambandham is Ramanujam. That is with Lachwana.

85
00:09:36 --> 00:09:42
 Dasya, the Seviya Sevaka Sammantha is with Hanuman. That is told by Madhvacharya.

86
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
 That is why in Madhva Matha Hanuman is very important. Not Lachwana.

87
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
 Lachwana is important in Ramanujamatha. In fact Ramanujamatha himself is called as Lachwana.

88
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
 He is Adi Shesha Avatara. Lachwana is also Adi Shesha Avatara.

89
00:10:00 --> 00:10:08
 Shesha Shesha Sammantha means the part and whole.

90
00:10:09 --> 00:10:15
 Sometimes we say, you both are my eyes.

91
00:10:15 --> 00:10:21
 That is the Shesha Shesha Sammantha. Part and whole.

92
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
 That is introduced by Ramanujamatha.

93
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
 And the Seviya Sevaka Sammantha is introduced by Manvacharya.

94
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
 Anything more?

95
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
 If nothing is there, we will end this session.

96
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
 Swamiji, last question.

97
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
 For suppose Ravana, of course Ravana is a villain in that character Rama.

98
00:10:56 --> 00:11:03
 For suppose Ravana, even entire Lanka was made of gold.

99
00:11:03 --> 00:11:07
 With entire gold along with Sita surrendered to Lord Rama.

100
00:11:07 --> 00:11:15
 He might have crossed even like Gopikas and Hanuman or not. Just a question.

101
00:11:15 --> 00:11:31
 If Ravana had surrendered Sita to Lord Rama along with his Lanka, would he have become a devotee then?

102
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
 I don't understand. You tell me Prasad.

103
00:11:35 --> 00:11:45
 If Ravana had surrendered Sita to Lord Rama along with his Lanka, would he have become a devotee then?

104
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
 What can I do?

105
00:11:47 --> 00:11:55
 Whatever you ask a question, you ask a question about Ravana.

106
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
 I will give the answer.

107
00:11:57 --> 00:12:05
 But every time Dick and Harry doing something, how can you ask question to me?

108
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
 I am not responsible for human beings.

109
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
 I am only responsible for God.

110
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
 God is not a human being.

111
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
 I am not responsible for human beings.

112
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
 I am only responsible for God.

113
00:12:24 --> 00:12:30
 God in absolute state or God in human form state.

114
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
 Rama did like this, how? You question, I will ask. I will answer.

115
00:12:34 --> 00:12:39
 Krishna did like this, how? You ask, I will answer.

116
00:12:39 --> 00:12:45
 But Satyartha did like this, how? You cannot ask.

117
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
 How can I answer? How I am responsible for the human being?

118
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
 Ravana is a human being.

119
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
 Ravana is not God.

120
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
 Ravana is not God.

121
00:12:56 --> 00:13:01
 I am standing on the side of God.

122
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
 Not on the side of souls.

123
00:13:04 --> 00:13:08
 Souls do several things.

124
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
 That is as per their samskaras.

125
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
 As per their qualities.

126
00:13:15 --> 00:13:20
 They have attained in the previous births.

127
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
 For that I am not...

128
00:13:22 --> 00:13:31
 See, I have come, I am standing only to answer about God.

129
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
 Not about... You also asked once question.

130
00:13:34 --> 00:13:43
 Why Shantanu did not object when Ganga is dipping the children in the Ganga?

131
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
 How I am responsible?

132
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
 Shantanu is not God.

133
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
 Ganga is not God.

134
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
 They both are souls.

135
00:13:53 --> 00:14:02
 When souls did something, if you are there in their time, you put a case in the court.

136
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
 Then the court will punish them.

137
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
 Israel is fault.

138
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
 I am not responsible.

139
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
 I am responsible only for God.

140
00:14:15 --> 00:14:19
 God in human form, God in energetic form.

141
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
 Their actions...

142
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25
 Why Krishna danced with the Guru? Because you asked me.

143
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
 I will tell for one day.

144
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
 Because it is related to God.

145
00:14:32 --> 00:14:42
 Swami, will God be pleased or not if he has done like that?

146
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
 God will be pleased or not if for suppose he has done like that?

147
00:14:46 --> 00:14:53
 If God is pleased, he would have not killed Ravana.

148
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
 Rama killed Ravana.

149
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
 Is it not?

150
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
 That means God is not pleased.

151
00:15:01 --> 00:15:12
 And to displease God by displeasing God, then only Ravana can become enemy to Rama.

152
00:15:12 --> 00:15:17
 When he became enemy, he can get salvation in three births.

153
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
 Not as a devotee.

154
00:15:21 --> 00:15:32
 If he behaves like a devotee, Ravana behaves, then he would have taken seven births to reach Vaikuntha.

155
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
 Definitely he behaved like enemy.

156
00:15:36 --> 00:15:41
 That is why he reached God in three births.

157
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
 That itself gives the answer logic.

158
00:15:44 --> 00:15:49
 That means if Rama is pleased, Ravana must be a devotee.

159
00:15:49 --> 00:15:54
 Is it not? Ravana cannot be enemy.

160
00:15:54 --> 00:16:02
 If Ravana is not pleased, then only Ravana can be enemy.

161
00:16:02 --> 00:16:09
 As enemy only in three births he will reach. That is the boon, you know, Vara.

162
00:16:09 --> 00:16:18
 That means Ravana behaved like enemy, must behave like enemy, according to the desire by Jaya and Vijaya.

163
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
 Since he behaved like enemy, Rama is not pleased.

164
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
 The answer lies there itself.

165
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
 Okay, Pramodji.

166
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
 Then the next program, Pramodji.

167
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
 Swami, I just got one doubt now, Swami.

168
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
 This is Veena Dutta.

169
00:16:36 --> 00:16:43
 Swami, Jaya and Vijaya might have taken these seven births only, no, Swami.

170
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
 Then that time also they will be with Lord only as friend.

171
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
 It is the same Lord here and there also.

172
00:16:49 --> 00:16:55
 No, suppose Jaya and Vijaya have taken seven births as devotees,

173
00:16:55 --> 00:17:01
 then Jaya and Vijaya would have not behaved like Ravana and Kumbhakarna.

174
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
 Yes, Swami, that is correct.

175
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
 Yes.

176
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
 This is not related to the old question, Swami.

177
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
 Yes, Swami, that is correct.

178
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
 Yes.

179
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
 This is not related to the old question, Swami.

180
00:17:19 --> 00:17:27
 But Jaya and Vijaya have chosen to reach Vaikuntha in three births only instead of taking seven births.

181
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
 Yes.

182
00:17:28 --> 00:17:36
 But they could have also chosen seven births because they will be with the same Lord here also as friend.

183
00:17:36 --> 00:17:50
 But Jaya and Vijaya have chosen three births and not seven births telling the reason that we cannot wait so long time separated from God.

184
00:17:50 --> 00:17:55
 God also will be incarnated in those seven births also, no, Swami.

185
00:17:55 --> 00:18:04
 God has chosen that option to become devotees in seven births.

186
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
 God would have agreed for that also. God gave two options.

187
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
 Okay, got it, Swami.

188
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
 Either in seven births as a devotee or in three births as enemy.

189
00:18:15 --> 00:18:24
 Then Jaya and Vijaya told, we cannot wait such a long time seven births to reach our God.

190
00:18:24 --> 00:18:32
 We will reach you in three births itself as enemies because the separation time is lesser.

191
00:18:32 --> 00:18:35
 Got it, Swami.

192
00:18:35 --> 00:18:41
 So they have chosen to be close in the form of Narayana only.

193
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
 To be close with Narayana early, as early as possible.

194
00:18:45 --> 00:18:52
 And that is possible only when they become enemies in three births.

195
00:18:52 --> 00:18:54
 Understood.

196
00:18:54 --> 00:18:56
 Understood.

197
00:19:02 --> 00:19:07
 Okay.
