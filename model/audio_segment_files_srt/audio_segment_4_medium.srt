1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
 I want some attachment.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:10
 If you detach yourself to coffee, attach myself to God.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:15
 Some attachment I want.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
 You cannot control mind when it rebels.

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
 If you are like a gentleman, then it will be also like a gentleman.

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
 If you rebel, no, no.

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
 Be detached from everything.

8
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
 No, it will rebel.

9
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
 You will be defeated by mind.

10
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
 So what is the question?

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:39
 I forget.

12
00:00:41 --> 00:00:42
 For what I have given the answer.

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
 So Swami, the question is like this.

14
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
 What is moksha?

15
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
 And you are by loving God.

16
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
 Loving God is moksha.

17
00:00:52 --> 00:00:53
 So I have given the answer.

18
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
 I have given the answer.

19
00:00:56 --> 00:00:57
 Yes, Swami.

20
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
 Yes, any question?

21
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
 Yes, Swami.

22
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
 One more question, Swami.

23
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
 This question is from Mr. Aravind.

24
00:01:01 --> 00:01:02
 Namaskaran, Swami.

25
00:01:02 --> 00:01:11
 Being an ordinary mortal coiled in worldly wants, will we get a chance to ever witness

26
00:01:11 --> 00:01:20
 God like how Swami Ramakrishna showed us the divine power of God?

27
00:01:20 --> 00:01:28
 To ever witness God like how Swami Ramakrishna showed Swami Vivekananda?

28
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
 Again, you repeat.

29
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
 In the earlier part, I did not catch.

30
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
 Okay, so I will repeat the question, Swami.

31
00:01:37 --> 00:01:49
 Being an ordinary mortal coiled in worldly wants, will we get a chance to ever witness

32
00:01:49 --> 00:01:58
 God like how Swami Ramakrishna showed Swami Vivekananda?

33
00:01:58 --> 00:02:10
 You see, I understood the spirit of the question.

34
00:02:10 --> 00:02:28
 Can we taste divine nectar when I am drinking coffee for every one hour in the day?

35
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
 Every one hour I need a cup of coffee.

36
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
 Can I taste that divine nectar?

37
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
 That is the question.

38
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
 Yes, you can taste.

39
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
 How?

40
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
 There is a procedure.

41
00:02:48 --> 00:02:56
 To taste the divine nectar, you must have the complete knowledge of the divine nectar.

42
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
 You don't know that divine nectar exists.

43
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
 How can this question come?

44
00:03:02 --> 00:03:13
 Even if you don't know, you are so much immersed in coffee that you never heard about divine nectar,

45
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
 then it is not possible.

46
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
 When it becomes possible?

47
00:03:18 --> 00:03:26
 When you get total knowledge of the divine nectar, then you will get interest.

48
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
 See, knowledge generates interest.

49
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
 First you must try for knowledge.

50
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
 How is Mumbai city?

51
00:03:36 --> 00:03:42
 You must hear what are the special things that can be seen in Mumbai city.

52
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
 If I go to Mumbai city, what are the attractive things?

53
00:03:47 --> 00:03:54
 You must get the knowledge of Mumbai, the details of Mumbai city from somebody.

54
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
 Then by hearing that knowledge, you will develop interest.

55
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
 That interest is called as devotion.

56
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
 So knowledge generates devotion.

57
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
 Gnana Yoga liberates Bhakti Yoga.

58
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
 Gnana Yoga develops Bhakti Yoga.

59
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
 Unless you hear, how can you develop interest?

60
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
 Interest is the devotion.

61
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
 Interest is the inspiration.

62
00:04:27 --> 00:04:33
 Then when you develop devotion, then you will make a triumph.

63
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
 You will go to the railway station.

64
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
 You will walk to the railway station.

65
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
 That is called as Karma Sanyasa.

66
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
 You will take money and purchase tickets for Mumbai.

67
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
 That is Karma Phalak Tyaga.

68
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
 So hearing the details of Mumbai city is Gnana Yoga.

69
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
 Developing interest to see Mumbai city is Bhakti Yoga.

70
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
 Walking up to railway station is Karma Sanyasa Yoga.

71
00:04:58 --> 00:05:06
 And taking money from the pocket and purchasing ticket for Mumbai is Karma Phalak Tyaga Yoga.

72
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
 These four steps must take place.

73
00:05:10 --> 00:05:17
 Then definitely you will taste divine nectar and leave the coffee.

74
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
 It is possible, provided you follow the procedure.

75
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
 So first what step you must take?

76
00:05:26 --> 00:05:32
 First step is stop the drinking of coffee for some time

77
00:05:32 --> 00:05:37
 and hear about divine nectar at least here.

78
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
 Or at least while taking coffee here.

79
00:05:47 --> 00:05:53
 Without that first step, can I see God?

80
00:05:53 --> 00:05:58
 First step is not possible.

81
00:05:58 --> 00:06:05
 We are not developing real interest even to hear the details of God.

82
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
 When we open TV, we see only cinemas.

83
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
 We don't see Samskar channel or Astha channel

84
00:06:15 --> 00:06:25
 in which divine things, stories about God and praise about God is told.

85
00:06:25 --> 00:06:30
 We don't have time to see Samskar channel.

86
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
 And we ask, can I have a chance to meet God?

87
00:06:35 --> 00:06:40
 Even to hear the details of God, you don't have time.

88
00:06:40 --> 00:06:46
 Time, you don't have minimum interest.

89
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
 How can you think of the result?

90
00:06:51 --> 00:06:56
 Dr. Geetha Lahari.

91
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
 Am I correct?

92
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
 The patient doesn't come to the hospital.

93
00:07:04 --> 00:07:09
 He wants perfect health.

94
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
 Is it possible?

95
00:07:13 --> 00:07:28
 One thing I am telling all of you, very seriously.

96
00:07:28 --> 00:07:38
 In so simple way,

97
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
 in so enlightened way,

98
00:07:43 --> 00:07:53
 I have not preached the spiritual knowledge in any incarnation.

99
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
 Still,

100
00:07:55 --> 00:08:03
 I have not preached the spiritual knowledge in any incarnation.

101
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
 Tomorrow when they come to hell,

102
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
 Sir, we don't know all this.

103
00:08:10 --> 00:08:14
 Nobody told us.

104
00:08:14 --> 00:08:20
 Had we known, we would have pierced.

105
00:08:20 --> 00:08:27
 You have pierced the spiritual knowledge.

106
00:08:27 --> 00:08:43
 My responsibility is over.

107
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
 I know that whether I preach or not preach,

108
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
 the result is going to be same.

109
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
 That I know very well.

110
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
 But still I am preaching so that tomorrow you will not say in the hell,

111
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
 Sir, we don't know about this thing.

112
00:08:59 --> 00:09:05
 Had we known, we would have moved the mountains.

113
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
 Due to ignorance, we could not do this.

114
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
 To escape.

115
00:09:14 --> 00:09:20
 Instead of getting rid of that blame,

116
00:09:20 --> 00:09:50
 I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

117
00:09:50 --> 00:09:57
 am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

118
00:09:57 --> 00:10:04
 am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

119
00:10:04 --> 00:10:11
 am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

120
00:10:11 --> 00:10:18
 am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I

121
00:10:18 --> 00:10:25
 will be more and more disqualified and that post will go more and more far. It is only

122
00:10:28 --> 00:10:35
 disqualifies. It only disqualifies. Instead of that you can say, I want to preach some

123
00:10:38 --> 00:10:45
 good spiritual knowledge to the humanity and help them in their salvation. That much is

124
00:10:48 --> 00:10:55
 enough. That much you can think. Then God will automatically make you incarnation. But

125
00:10:56 --> 00:11:03
 starting itself, I want to make him incarnation. The liking is for the child, not for the responsibility.

126
00:11:03 --> 00:11:10
 Our always accompany the responsibilities. There is a saying, ours always accompany the

127
00:11:22 --> 00:11:29
 responsibilities. So you think of the responsibility. Do not think of the power. If you think that

128
00:11:30 --> 00:11:37
 I want to become human incarnation, that means you are aspiring for power, not responsibility.

129
00:11:37 --> 00:11:44
 Suppose you think, I want to serve the humanity, I want to help some human beings from the

130
00:11:47 --> 00:11:54
 ignorance and lead them to the true spiritual knowledge, to the true path to God, I want

131
00:11:54 --> 00:12:01
 to help. That is responsibility. If you think responsibility, power will be given. If you

132
00:12:03 --> 00:12:10
 think power, you will be moved far and far from the position. Follow?

133
00:12:15 --> 00:12:21
 What can we do to not to sprout that idea of getting incarnation, Swami?

134
00:12:21 --> 00:12:28
 Do you think about that like this? As I told, we should not aspire for power. We should aspire only for

135
00:12:31 --> 00:12:38
 responsibility. That you repeatedly think that will form a samskara in you. And that will always come to your risk

136
00:12:38 --> 00:12:45
 at the proper time.

137
00:12:47 --> 00:12:54
 Padanamaskaram, Swami. Swami, you told the personal work of God is 100% related to God only.

138
00:12:58 --> 00:13:03
 What is the reason for that?

139
00:13:03 --> 00:13:10
 As I told, the personal work of God is 100% related to God only. If you see the mission of God, it is 50%

140
00:13:13 --> 00:13:20
 related to the welfare of the souls and 50% related to God. Because God is pleased by the mission.

141
00:13:22 --> 00:13:29
 Geeta says that perfect devotee shall have 100% concentration on God only, which is called as single-pointed devotion.

142
00:13:34 --> 00:13:41
 Some devotees say that they are unable to do personal service to Swami and they are not much interested in

143
00:13:44 --> 00:13:51
 propagation of Swami's knowledge. So, does this show that their higher level of one-pointed devotion to Swami?

144
00:13:54 --> 00:14:01
 Yes, perfectly that is correct. After all, the higher level of one-pointed devotion to Swami is not

145
00:14:03 --> 00:14:10
 what is the ultimate spiritual effort of sathana to develop 100% concentration on God.

146
00:14:14 --> 00:14:21
 That is everything. Why should you worry about the mission of God?

147
00:14:23 --> 00:14:29
 Even without you, he can do it in fraction of second. If he wants.

148
00:14:30 --> 00:14:37
 Unless you help, he can't do it. Is he so incapable?

149
00:14:39 --> 00:14:47
 Is God Rama so incapable of crossing the sea, killing Ravana and getting back Sita?

150
00:14:50 --> 00:14:58
 In fact, it is also correct because he needed to cross the sea. If he thinks, let Ravana die, let Sita come to my side.

151
00:15:00 --> 00:15:07
 It will happen in fraction of second. No need of bridge, no need of war.

152
00:15:09 --> 00:15:15
 Why should you think about the propagation of spiritual knowledge?

153
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
 If suppose God thinks, let all be liberated, all be liberated.

154
00:15:20 --> 00:15:33
 Even if you do some propagation work of God, you will put your dirty finger somewhere and spoil the mission only.

155
00:15:35 --> 00:15:41
 And spoil the propagation of spiritual knowledge because somewhere you will show your intelligence.

156
00:15:42 --> 00:15:50
 And give a false concept. Interpret, misinterpret the concept.

157
00:15:51 --> 00:16:00
 Because we are dog's tails. We are dog's tails. Our tail never is straight.

158
00:16:01 --> 00:16:08
 So if some concept is told by God is to be preached to public, he will certainly curve it.

159
00:16:08 --> 00:16:16
 So instead of spoiling, better keep silent. God will himself do it.

160
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
 So that is not the point at all. That is not the...

161
00:16:22 --> 00:16:30
 The entire essence of the spiritual knowledge is to develop full concentration on God only.

162
00:16:30 --> 00:16:35
 Leave everything behind. Leave everything aside.

163
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
 The only essence is God.

164
00:16:40 --> 00:16:46
 If God wants, whether it is personal work or public work, that is immaterial to me.

165
00:16:47 --> 00:16:53
 What he wants, that is the essence.

166
00:16:53 --> 00:17:02
 That is the essence. That is the essence of the entire scriptures.

167
00:17:03 --> 00:17:10
 Holy concentration. What he... You see, that is what in Krishna Bhagavatam there is one sloka.

168
00:17:11 --> 00:17:17
 Apapunya vivekaya kuto yam grandhavistara. The gopikas were sages previously.

169
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
 They wrote the ethics, dharmashastras.

170
00:17:22 --> 00:17:31
 They told, papapunya vivekaya, which is punyam and which is papam, for that, why we have written so many dharmashastras?

171
00:17:32 --> 00:17:39
 What is punyam and what is papam can be told in one sentence. Why we have written unnecessarily so many books?

172
00:17:40 --> 00:17:45
 What is that one sentence? Hare kopa karam papam punyantasya priya pradham.

173
00:17:45 --> 00:17:50
 What is dharma? What is punyam? That which pleases God is punyam.

174
00:17:51 --> 00:17:58
 That which is disliked by God is adharma or papa.

175
00:17:59 --> 00:18:09
 One sentence. Why we have written so many books to explain what is papa, what is punyam, what is dharma, what is adharma?

176
00:18:10 --> 00:18:20
 Simply one sentence we could have told. Hare kopa karam papam. If it is not liked by God, that is papam.

177
00:18:21 --> 00:18:26
 Punyantasya priya pradham. If it is liked by God, that is punyam, that is dharma.

178
00:18:26 --> 00:18:40
 In one sentence it is told, it can be told. Why we have written so many dharmashastras for papa, punyam, dharma and adharma?

179
00:18:45 --> 00:18:53
 That is the highest concept. Before that highest concept, all other are only secondary concepts.

180
00:18:53 --> 00:18:58
 Secondary concepts cannot cross the highest concept.

181
00:19:01 --> 00:19:08
 What is that highest concept? Hanuman is the highest concept. Radha is the highest concept.

182
00:19:09 --> 00:19:19
 What can cross Radha and Hanuman? And what they have did? Complete 100% concentration on God.

183
00:19:19 --> 00:19:25
 That too can't be human incarnation.

184
00:19:26 --> 00:19:36
 We say Bhagavatam is the highest. We say Ramayanam is the highest. But we don't accept the essence.

185
00:19:36 --> 00:19:48
 We accept Ramayanam Bhagavatam, the highest. We accept Ramayanam Krishna also as Gods.

186
00:19:49 --> 00:19:59
 But Ramayanam is human being, Krishna is human being. Can you accept human form as God? No, no, that time we can't.

187
00:19:59 --> 00:20:05
 What they are teaching? Those epics are teaching.

188
00:20:06 --> 00:20:17
 And by catching contemporary human incarnation, Hanuman has gone to Brahmaloka and Radha has gone to Goloka.

189
00:20:18 --> 00:20:23
 Highest, highest fruits. There is no higher fruit than that.

190
00:20:23 --> 00:20:29
 But why you are not accepting contemporary human incarnation?

191
00:20:30 --> 00:20:35
 You accept the concept, but don't accept the example.

192
00:20:36 --> 00:20:44
 That is the human weakness. That is the defect of human mind.

193
00:20:44 --> 00:20:56
 Why he is losing? He is losing the actual point. Everything he is catching.

194
00:20:57 --> 00:21:01
 When the actual point comes, he loses it.

195
00:21:01 --> 00:21:18
 What is the use of catching all the other things and leaving the actual, not clue, essence?

196
00:21:22 --> 00:21:25
 Any other question?

197
00:21:26 --> 00:21:31
 Swami, there are some online questions Swami.

198
00:21:32 --> 00:21:38
 This question is asked by Mr. Anil.

199
00:21:39 --> 00:21:53
 10 rupees of hardened money also goes along with 10 paisa of corrupt money like compartments of train tied together. Why it is so?

200
00:21:54 --> 00:21:56
 Again you repeat the question.

201
00:21:57 --> 00:22:13
 Ok Swami. 10 rupees of hardened money also goes along with 10 paisa of corrupt money like compartments of train tied together. Why it is so?

202
00:22:13 --> 00:22:26
 I am not catching the essence of the question.

203
00:22:27 --> 00:22:31
 Why it is so means it is like Sathiridhi asking question.

204
00:22:32 --> 00:22:42
 Swami, when you came as Vamana, you suppressed Bari Chakravarthi.

205
00:22:43 --> 00:22:51
 Instead of that you could have asked when Vamana came to suppress Bari Chakravarthi, like that you can start.

206
00:22:51 --> 00:23:01
 When you came as Vamana, so that Kerala government will send police to arrest me.

207
00:23:02 --> 00:23:08
 Because for them Bari Chakravarthi is very important. Onam festival, you know, the worship of Bali.

208
00:23:09 --> 00:23:14
 Why it is so means what can I do?

209
00:23:14 --> 00:23:24
 That is a natural phenomenon. Why mango fruit comes to mango tree? It comes like that.

210
00:23:25 --> 00:23:38
 So one thing I can say here that 10 rupees justified money and 10 paisa corrupt money.

211
00:23:39 --> 00:23:57
 From this I can draw one concept that is even a person who is following justified path, most of his path is justified.

212
00:23:57 --> 00:24:06
 But somewhere he does some 10 paisa corruption. Somewhere he slips.

213
00:24:07 --> 00:24:13
 In some small place at least he slips and earns 10 paisa.

214
00:24:14 --> 00:24:24
 Then only every 10 rupees, every justified, justified earned 10 rupees, 10 corrupt paisa will go.

215
00:24:24 --> 00:24:33
 That means a person who earns 10 rupees in justified way is not present in the world.

216
00:24:34 --> 00:24:39
 In this world, at least in this Kali Yuga.

217
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
 That is the conclusion I can draw from him, from his question.

218
00:24:46 --> 00:25:03
 That shows the present situation of the world in Kali Yuga that every there is no 100 percent absolute justified person.

219
00:25:04 --> 00:25:11
 Because in Kali Yuga three fourth is injustice. One fourth is only justice.

220
00:25:11 --> 00:25:16
 Therefore injustice is ruling the Kali Yuga.

221
00:25:17 --> 00:25:21
 So there is no 100 percent justified person.

222
00:25:22 --> 00:25:30
 Even if you call somebody as 100 percent justified person, he might have earned 10 rupees through justice.

223
00:25:31 --> 00:25:38
 But at least 10 paisa earned through injustice must be existing with him.

224
00:25:38 --> 00:25:44
 So you ask why? Why means it is because of this Kali age.

225
00:25:45 --> 00:25:51
 Why Kali age? Why you are blaming Kali time?

226
00:25:52 --> 00:25:58
 Yes, in fact we should not blame time. We should blame ourselves.

227
00:25:59 --> 00:26:18
 That means our ethical standards have fallen today to such extent that we don't find any 100 percent justified person in the present time.

228
00:26:19 --> 00:26:26
 At least some little one paisa injustice must be with everybody.

229
00:26:27 --> 00:26:37
 But by this you should not develop a concept that how can you advise me?

230
00:26:38 --> 00:26:42
 You are also having one paisa injustice.

231
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
 You see you are having one paisa injustice but I am having 90 paisa injustice.

232
00:26:50 --> 00:26:55
 That is why you can advise me. You should see the quantity also.

233
00:26:56 --> 00:26:59
 Not quality only, quantity also.

234
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
 See you have come to this house.

235
00:27:03 --> 00:27:10
 One mustard seed might have stuck to your pant and you might have gone to home.

236
00:27:11 --> 00:27:14
 That is also theft of mustard seed.

237
00:27:16 --> 00:27:24
 And one another fellow saw some pumpkin fruit and might have stolen it to the house.

238
00:27:26 --> 00:27:28
 That is also qualitatively theft.

239
00:27:29 --> 00:27:39
 Then the thief of mustard seed can advise that other fellow don't steal pumpkin fruit.

240
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
 It will become theft.

241
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
 You also stole mustard seed.

242
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
 What right you have to advise me?

243
00:27:52 --> 00:27:53
 Not like that.

244
00:27:53 --> 00:27:54
 Not like that.

245
00:27:55 --> 00:27:57
 Quantitative difference must be also taken.

246
00:27:58 --> 00:28:11
 After one paisa injustice by his lack of attention, by his negligence it might have been done.

247
00:28:12 --> 00:28:19
 Thinking that it is also correct, he might have done that one paisa injustice.

248
00:28:19 --> 00:28:36
 So, like that, that shows the general fall of standard of ethics and general fall of devotion to God.

249
00:28:37 --> 00:28:42
 If devotion to God is there, sin will not be done.

250
00:28:43 --> 00:28:47
 In fear relaxation may come.

251
00:28:47 --> 00:28:53
 But if devotion is there to God, the sin will not happen.

252
00:28:54 --> 00:29:07
 If unintentionally, unknowingly some trace of sin happens, it will not create much problem to him.

253
00:29:08 --> 00:29:09
 It is unintentional.

254
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
 You are walking on the road, the ant has fallen under your feet.

255
00:29:14 --> 00:29:15
 It died.

256
00:29:16 --> 00:29:17
 There is no intention.

257
00:29:18 --> 00:29:19
 It is not a sin.

258
00:29:23 --> 00:29:30
 Therefore, you have to treat such people also as 100% justified people.

259
00:29:31 --> 00:29:32
 Ok?

260
00:29:33 --> 00:29:34
 Yes, Swami.

261
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
 Swami, next question is from Mr. Ansraj.

262
00:29:40 --> 00:29:41
 Namaskaran, Swami.

263
00:29:42 --> 00:29:50
 What are the various forms of theoretical and practical devotion that can be practised?

264
00:29:50 --> 00:29:59
 What are the various forms of theoretical and practical devotion that can be practised?
