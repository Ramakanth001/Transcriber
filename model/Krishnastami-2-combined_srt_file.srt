 These three are present in human incarnation also.

290
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
 Human body, every human body contains energy,

291
00:29:31 --> 00:29:36
 inert energy, inert matter and non-inert awareness.

292
00:29:36 --> 00:29:41
 So these three means the human incarnation, Sadguru.

293
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
 So that is the pratika, represented model for the Sadguru.

294
00:29:46 --> 00:29:51
 So when it becomes instavarnasam, again fresh pratika is born.

295
00:29:51 --> 00:29:56
 So when it becomes instavarnasam, again fresh pratika is born.

296
00:29:56 --> 00:00:06

297
00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
 So new Egya Veda is to be put.

298
00:00:10 --> 00:00:18
 The Sadguru after preaching the disciples after some time, he will become dirty.

299
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
 Because of the dirt of the disciples, he will become dirty.

300
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
 So the Sadguru must be changed.

301
00:00:25 --> 00:00:36
 He must be changed because of our dirt, he will become dirty.

302
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
 Otherwise he is pure.

303
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
 This happened to the temples.

304
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
 This happened to deities of temples.

305
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52

452
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
 Everything is sweet.

453
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
 He has a sugar problem.

454
00:20:28 --> 00:20:39
 That is why Vidura gave him the outer skin of the banana fruit and threw the fruit.

455
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
 Because fruit contains sugar.

456
00:20:41 --> 00:20:46
 In that outer leather, it contains vitamins and minerals.

457
00:20:46 --> 00:20:52
 And he, you know, after coming to Vidura's house, straightly he went to war.

458
00:20:52 --> 00:20:58
 In war, when arrows come, especially in Bhishma, through lot of arrows are Krishna.

459
00:20:58 --> 00:21:00
 Krishna was injured by it.

460
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
 So if he is sugar, since he has sugar, bleeding will not stop.

461
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
 If sugar is there, bleeding will not stop.

462
00:21:10 --> 00:21:17
 That is why thinking all this in future, very near future, Vidura gave him the banana leather

463
00:21:17 --> 00:21:19
 and threw the fruit.

464
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
 Because sugar will increase, then in the war arrow will come, then bleeding will not stop.

465
00:21:25 --> 00:21:31
 So he threw the fruit out and gave the leather of the banana fruit.

466
00:21:31 --> 00:21:35
 Because everything is sweet.

467
00:21:35 --> 00:21:51
 So I have, from the Krishna avatar, I have also imbibed one quality, that is sugar.

468
00:21:51 --> 00:21:59
 In that one quality, I am similar to Krishna.

469
00:21:59 --> 00:22:07
 That is wonderful, right?

470
00:22:07 --> 00:22:09
 Yes.

471
00:22:09 --> 00:23:37
 Go pick up

472
00:23:37 --> 00:23:45
 Go pick up

476
00:24:26 --> 00:24:56

477
00:24:56 --> 00:25:04
 Audio is not there.

478
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
 Audio

479
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
 I stood there

480
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
 I wetted

481
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
 I wetted

482
00:25:15 --> 00:25:17
 I wetted

483
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
 I wetted

484
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
 I wetted

485
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
 I wetted

486
00:25:23 --> 00:25:25
 I wetted

487
00:25:25 --> 00:25:31
 She told, I have seen this for 40 days.

488
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
 I want to get a job for my son.

489
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
 That is why I said.

490
00:25:39 --> 00:25:51
 I told her, even though you have a desire, your devotion is in your desire,

491
00:25:51 --> 00:25:53
 but you are singing, move my heart.

492
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
 My heart is blighted.

493
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
 I wept.

494
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
 I told her, definitely Krishna will bless you.

495
00:26:03 --> 00:26:07
 Next day, again and again I gave.

496
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
 No bhajan.

497
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
 Then I went inside and laughed.

498
00:26:11 --> 00:26:14
 I went inside and laughed.

499
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
 I went inside and laughed.

500
00:26:16 --> 00:26:18
 I went inside and laughed.

501
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
 Krishna really blessed.

502
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
 Krishna really blessed.

503
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
 Krishna really blessed.

504
00:26:24 --> 00:26:26
 Krishna really blessed.

505
00:26:26 --> 00:26:28
 Because he was moved.

506
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
 Because he was moved by the desire.

507
00:26:30 --> 00:26:34
 I told her, even though your devotion is with a desire,

508
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
 but Krishna is moved with your song,

509
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
 he has came for the lines.

510
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
 That is why he will be blessed.

511
00:26:40 --> 00:26:43
 Maybe there, maybe there.

512
00:26:43 --> 00:26:45
 But in that case, it is very easy.

513
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
 That is bhajan.

514
00:26:47 --> 00:27:45
 Jnana dana Radha Jeevana

515
00:27:45 --> 00:27:49

524
00:28:09 --> 00:28:12
 Thank you.

525
00:28:12 --> 00:28:20
 The song ended with an appointment.

526
00:28:20 --> 00:28:22
 Yes.

527
00:28:22 --> 00:28:24
 Did I?

528
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
 Yes, an appointment.

529
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
 Thank you.

530
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
 It is like,

531
00:28:30 --> 00:28:32
 there is a story.

532
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
 A big scholar went to a king.

533
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 The king was very much pleased

534
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
 with his scholarly knowledge.

535
00:28:38 --> 00:28:41
 With his scholarlyness and all that.

536
00:28:41 --> 00:28:43
 Poetry and scholarlyness.

537
00:28:43 --> 00:28:45
 He was very much pleased.

538
00:28:45 --> 00:28:47
 The king asked,

539
00:28:47 --> 00:28:49
 what do you want?

540
00:28:49 --> 00:28:51
 I want to give a gift.

541
00:28:51 --> 00:28:53
 The scholar told,

542
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
 today morning,

543
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
 my towel for taking bath,

544
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
 that rat spoiled that towel.

545
00:28:59 --> 00:29:01
 I want one towel.

546
00:29:01 --> 00:29:11
 The king wanted to give

547
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
 golden necklace, diamond,

548
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
 golden ornaments,

549
00:29:15 --> 00:29:17
 diamonds.

550
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
 Lot of wealth he wanted to give.

551
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
 He was so much impressed.

552
00:29:21 --> 00:29:23
 And the scholar asked,

553
00:29:23 --> 00:29:25
 one towel.

554
00:29:25 --> 00:29:27
 It is a problem for taking bath.

555
00:29:27 --> 00:29:29
 That rat has spoiled that towel.

556
00:29:29 --> 00:29:31
 It is a problem for taking bath.

557
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
 That rat has spoiled that towel.

558
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
 It is a problem for taking bath.

559
00:29:35 --> 00:29:37
 That rat has spoiled that towel.

560
00:29:37 --> 00:29:40
 I am asking the third day,

561
00:29:40 --> 00:29:42
 Bhojanandeshya Rajendra.

562
00:29:42 --> 00:29:54
 I tell a story also

563
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
 in this context.

564
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
 I think you all know.

565
00:29:58 --> 00:30:00
 One son came

566
00:30:00 --> 00:30:02
 and started to study.

567
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
 He was a very educated.

568
00:30:04 --> 00:30:06
 He studied a lot.

569
00:30:06 --> 00:00:06
 started pressing the feet of the father. He wanted 1000 rupees from the father for some

570
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
 luxury, some enjoyment, pity enjoyment, like cinema or something, something like that.

571
00:00:12 --> 00:00:19
 For one hour he continuously pressed. The father was so much pleased, oh he is pressing

572
00:00:19 --> 00:00:28
 my feet with love, pure love, aspirationless love, with true love on me, he is pressing

573
00:00:28 --> 00:00:35
 the feet. Then he thought, the father thought, tomorrow I shall call the advocate. He is

574
00:00:35 --> 00:00:43
 the owner of property of several crores. All my property I shall write a will with the

575
00:00:43 --> 00:00:50
 help of that advocate. All my property I shall give that property to the son. Tomorrow I

576
00:00:50 --> 00:00:57
 shall call the advocate. That he was thinking. Then the son told, father, if you are pleased

577
00:00:57 --> 00:01:11
 with my service, I want 1000 rupees. For what purpose he asked? For some, going some pleasure.

578
00:01:11 --> 00:01:17
 He told, the pleasures are not good for health. So I am not giving that 1000 rupees. That

579
00:01:17 --> 00:01:32
 And also this will also, he lost the idea. He is not prepared to write the will. How

580
00:01:32 --> 00:01:41
 that desire spoils the entire thing, just like a drop of poison spoils the milk of the

581
00:01:41 --> 00:01:57
 whole big pot of milk. Poison drop mixed with the milk, the whole milk has become poison.

582
00:01:57 --> 00:02:06
 You cannot separate the milk from poison. It is mere milk. Same milk, mere milk, if

583
00:02:06 --> 00:02:15
 it is mixed with sugar, it will be far far better. So mere milk is better than poisoned

584
00:02:15 --> 00:02:28
 milk and sugar milk is better than mere milk. Is it not? So worldly desire mixed with devotion

585
00:02:28 --> 00:02:42
 is like poisoned milk. Simply desire is like mere milk. But desire mixed with, for God,

586
00:02:42 --> 00:02:50
 that is sugar milk. Sugar milk is better than milk and milk is better than poisoned milk.

587
00:02:50 --> 00:03:11
 I gave that simile in the morning answer. The karma, abhyasa and karma and jnana sahitha

588
00:03:11 --> 00:03:21
 karma. The abhyasa means the practice or action mixed with ignorance. You are blindly

589
00:03:21 --> 00:03:27
 doing a practice. You don't have knowledge of that practice. You don't have the aim of

590
00:03:27 --> 00:03:35
 that practice. That aim of the practice is only to have some pleasures, worldly pleasures.

591
00:03:35 --> 00:03:47
 That is doing ignorance. Doing ignorance to go to heaven. There also you are doing that

592
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
 ignorance not properly. Everything is twisted, everything is misinterpreted way. You are

593
00:03:53 --> 00:04:02
 doing that ignorance. Burning the ghee in the fire. So that is abhyasa. Abhyasa means

594
00:04:02 --> 00:04:17
 jnana sahitha karma. Practice action mixed with ignorance. Then mere karma is better

595
00:04:17 --> 00:04:27
 than that abhyasa. And jnana sahitha karma, the action mixed with knowledge is better

596
00:04:27 --> 00:04:38
 than mere karma. Jnatva kurvita karma. Sugar milk, like sugar milk.

597
00:04:38 --> 00:04:46
 What is the example for ignorance mixed action and pure action?

598
00:04:46 --> 00:04:57
 Ignorance mixed action. See, yajna is to be done. Yajna means cooking food with ghee,

599
00:04:57 --> 00:05:10
 and worshipping the Sadguru and other devotees. Giving this ghee fried food to sacrifice this

600
00:05:10 --> 00:05:20
 ghee fried food in the hunger fire, Vaishvanaragi of the Sadguru. That is jnana sahitha karma,

601
00:05:20 --> 00:05:40
 just mixed with sugar. So here poisoned milk is doing the same ignorance in a spoiled way,

602
00:05:40 --> 00:05:50
 in a misinterpreted way. Fire means hunger fire in the actual jnana sahitha karma. But

603
00:05:50 --> 00:06:00
 here they take physical fire as the agni. And they take the ghee fried food. Ghee fried

604
00:06:00 --> 00:06:14
 food is called as ghee. Doctor says, don't take much oil. Means oily food, avoid oily food. I don't drink oil.

605
00:06:14 --> 00:06:28
 Oil means oily food. So here they took oil, the ghee as ghee. Ghee is not ghee. Ghee is ghee fried food.

606
00:06:28 --> 00:06:37
 The possessor of an item is called by the name of the item. Suppose a seller of apples is going,

607
00:06:37 --> 00:06:45
 oh apples come. You are calling apples. Apples means seller of apples is called by the name of

608
00:06:45 --> 00:06:52
 the item, possessor by the, possessor. Possessor is called by the name of the possessor item.

609
00:06:52 --> 00:07:05
 That is lakshanartha. That is called as lakshanartha. So here they have taken the physical fire is used

610
00:07:05 --> 00:07:13
 to cook the food. And after cooking the food, that food is to be burnt in the hunger fire

611
00:07:13 --> 00:07:24
 of the hungry people, hungry guests. They have taken hunger fire, the possessor of the hunger fire

612
00:07:24 --> 00:07:31
 is also called as hunger fire. In Vedas it is when, who is that?

613
00:07:31 --> 00:07:51
 When Naciketa goes to Yama's house, for three days he was not supplied with food. He fasted for three days.

614
00:07:51 --> 00:08:01
 Madhguruhay, he has fasted for the last three nights. That is what Yama says to Naciketa.

615
00:08:01 --> 00:08:13
 Then Naciketa is told, Vaishvanara Pravesh, Brahmano gruham. This Naciketa is the Vaishvanara fire.

616
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
 Possessor of Vaishvanara fire is called by the name of Vaishvanara fire.

617
00:08:19 --> 00:08:27
 Possessor of apples is called as apples. Possessor of Vaishvanara fire is also called as Vaishvanara fire.

618
00:08:27 --> 00:08:42
 That is fire. So you must supply ghee to the fire. That is the sentence. Here in the literal sense,

619
00:08:42 --> 00:08:48
 you must supply the ghee to the physical fire. That is the vachyatha, literal sense.

620
00:08:48 --> 00:08:56
 But implied sense is, ghee means food possessed, possessing ghee is called as ghee.

621
00:08:56 --> 00:09:05
 Possessor of apples is called as apples. Similarly, fire means possessing the hunger fire is called as fire.

622
00:09:05 --> 00:09:12
 It is not physical fire. It is hunger fire. Here it is not ghee. It is food possessed with the ghee.

623
00:09:12 --> 00:09:22
 So you supply the food possessed with the ghee to a hungry person, hungry guest, to that fire.

624
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
 He is having a hunger fire. So he is fire. So these people, what they thought?

625
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
 Instead of taking implied sense, they have taken the literal sense.

626
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
 He means fire. Fire means that fire. Put the ghee in that fire. Burn it.

627
00:09:38 --> 00:09:48
 That is called as abhyasa. Abhyasa means tradition. My father did like that. My grandfather did like that.

628
00:09:48 --> 00:09:55
 My grand grandfather did like this. So let me do. That is called the abhyasa, blind tradition.

629
00:09:55 --> 00:10:01
 In which the action is mixed with ignorance.

630
00:10:01 --> 00:10:08
 Because the fire is understood as hungry person, nor ghee is understood as food possessing ghee.

631
00:10:08 --> 00:10:15
 That is ignorance only. Not knowing the implied sense is agnana only.

632
00:10:15 --> 00:10:23
 Lachchanartha, agnana, agnana. Not knowing the Lachchanartha implied sense is ignorance.

633
00:10:23 --> 00:10:29
 So the performance of yajna, sacrifice is with ignorance.

634
00:10:29 --> 00:10:36
 Then this misinterpretation is the positive.

635
00:10:36 --> 00:10:47
 Same yajna, that is same milk, mere karma. That is mere milk. When it is mixed with sugar,

636
00:10:47 --> 00:10:57
 the fire is taken as the person possessing hunger fire. The ghee is taken as the food possessing ghee.

637
00:10:57 --> 00:11:07
 And it is supplied to the fire. Fire means hunger fire. Hunger fire means the possession of the hunger fire.

638
00:11:07 --> 00:11:20
 Here the Rukyada mantra says that the fire is burning the food and is also supplying the food.

639
00:11:20 --> 00:11:31
 Agrim hotaram. Two words he has given. Agri. Agri means fire. Receiving the food, receiving the ghee.

640
00:11:31 --> 00:11:41
 That is ghee food. And he is also the same Agri. He is supplying the food, this ghee. How it can supply it? It is inert.

641
00:11:41 --> 00:11:51
 Human being priest is supplying the ghee to the fire. But the fire is said to be the supplier of food also.

642
00:11:51 --> 00:11:59
 Not only Havaniyya, inert fire, but also the Hota, supplier of the ghee. How the inert fire can become?

643
00:11:59 --> 00:12:11
 Supplier as well as receiver. That applies when the hungry person is eating the food.

644
00:12:11 --> 00:12:21
 He is supplying the food, he is Hota, and that is burnt in the hunger fire. It is how many it is also receiver?

645
00:12:21 --> 00:12:43
 So the Yajna is milk, mere milk. With bad interpretation it is poisoned milk. With good interpretation it is sugar mixed milk.

646
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
 Swami here mere milk means how to do that Yajna? Is it feeding people or is it pouring ghee?

647
00:12:49 --> 00:12:57
 Everything karma, action. Practice. Practical thing, action. Mere action.

648
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
 Then this also, Abhyasa also mere action.

649
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
 Abhyasa is not mere action. With twisted meaning, with wrong meaning it is interpreted.

650
00:13:05 --> 00:13:13
 The fire is taken as the physical fire, receiver. Ghee is taken as the, ghee fried food is taken as ghee.

651
00:13:13 --> 00:13:21
 And putting the ghee in the physical fire, burning the ghee in the physical fire is the poison.

652
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
 This is misinterpreted meaning is the poison.

653
00:13:25 --> 00:13:35
 The same action, same sacrifice, mixed with misinterpreted poisonous interpretation is Abhyasa.

654
00:13:35 --> 00:13:41
 That is done by poor of Imam's class. And Shankara condemned that.

655
00:13:41 --> 00:13:51
 Shankara condemned the poisoned milk. So what they thought, Shankara condemned both milk and poison.

656
00:13:51 --> 00:13:57
 Shankara condemned only poison. But he condemned, he has to condemn the poisoned milk.

657
00:13:57 --> 00:14:03
 Because the poison is mixed with milk. Poison cannot be isolated from milk.

658
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
 He did not condemn the milk. He condemned only the poison.

659
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
 So he condemned Agnana but he did not condemn Karma.

660
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
 He did not condemn Karma.

661
00:14:15 --> 00:14:25
 If he has condemned Karma, why he appreciated the Kumarila Bhatta who is Gnana Karma Samucheyavada,

662
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
 that is the milk mixed with sugar is appreciated by Shankara.

663
00:14:31 --> 00:14:39
 That means he is not rejecting mere milk. He is rejecting only the poison.

664
00:14:39 --> 00:14:45
 But since poison cannot be isolated from that milk, that poisoned milk, he rejected.

665
00:14:45 --> 00:14:53
 This poisoned milk should be rejected. He is not against the milk. He is against the poison only.

666
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
 Wonderful Sona.

667
00:14:55 --> 00:15:03
 Again there is poison milk. So Shankara has again come back.

668
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
 That is what I mean. It is a simile.

669
00:15:07 --> 00:15:23
 Swami, have a doubt. My doubt is that you have done Yashwamedha Yagam in Ramayanam.

670
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
 I did not understand. Now Krishna has come with Krishna and asked him to do Yashwamedha Yagam.

671
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
 In Ramayanam there are many different shlokas.

672
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
 That means inserted shlokas by others.

673
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
 Many shlokas have been inserted.

674
00:15:41 --> 00:15:47
 In Smritu, in History, how to do that Yashwamedha Yagam.

675
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
 They have inserted.

676
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
 What they have done is, they have removed some shlokas and

677
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
 they have done Yashwamedha Yagam.

678
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
 So, they have done Yashwamedha Yagam.

679
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
 This is not a sin.

680
00:16:03 --> 00:16:09
 Now, you have to get angry with the people who are against the religion of Hinduism.

681
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
 They have to get angry with the people who are against the religion of Hinduism.

682
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
 They have to spoil the religion of Hinduism.

683
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
 They have inserted these shlokas to spoil it.

684
00:16:17 --> 00:16:21
 Yashwamedha means senses.

685
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
 To make these senses pure is Yashwamedha.

686
00:16:25 --> 00:16:35
 What they do for that is, they make a dog with the flour and cut it with a knife.

687
00:16:35 --> 00:16:47
 The dog made with the flour is a representative model for the senses.

688
00:16:47 --> 00:16:57
 To control these senses, they have done a psychological model on the representative model.

689
00:16:57 --> 00:17:03
 To get the psychological inspiration, they use the knife to cut the dog.

690
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
 The dog with the flour.

691
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
 Not to cut the dog's throat.

692
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
 To get the inspiration.

693
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
 To control the senses.

694
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
 This is not a sin.

695
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
 This is not a sin.

696
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
 This is not a sin.

697
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
 This is not a sin.

698
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
 This is not a sin.

699
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
 This is not a sin.

700
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
 This is not a sin.

701
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
 This is not a sin.

702
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
 This is not a sin.

703
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
 This is not a sin.

704
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
 This is not a sin.

705
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
 This is not a sin.

706
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
 This is not a sin.

707
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
 This is not a sin.

708
00:17:41 --> 00:17:53
 When our minds think of food, lunch or dinner,

890
00:27:13 --> 00:27:18
 Yes Swami. Thank you Swami.

891
00:27:18 --> 00:27:25
 In Buddhism, Buddha taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

892
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
 Yes, Buddha is the one who taught us.

893
00:27:29 --> 00:27:35
 Ramo Ramasya Budhasya Buddha Kalikirevaja

894
00:27:35 --> 00:27:39
 Ramo Ramasya Krishnasya Buddha Kalikirevaja

895
00:27:39 --> 00:27:42
 Buddha taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

896
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
 Buddha taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

897
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
 Is it the same as our Krishna taught us?

898
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
 Where is the Buddha?

899
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
 If you say that Hindu taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma,

900
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
 then our Lord Krishna is the one who taught us.

901
00:27:54 --> 00:28:27
 All the other Gopas are devotees.

902
00:28:27 --> 00:28:32
 They are hungry.

903
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
 They can't eat.

904
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 He practically showed us the knowledge.

905
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40
 To spoil the knowledge is like spoiling the Gopis.

906
00:28:40 --> 00:28:44
 He spoilt the knowledge too.

907
00:28:44 --> 00:28:51
 He gave a fight to the Gopis like he gave a victory to the Gopis.

908
00:28:51 --> 00:28:57
 He gave a fight to the Gopis by testing them with the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

909
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
 I said it as a joke.

910
00:28:59 --> 00:29:01
 They said it as a joke.

911
00:29:01 --> 00:29:03
 But he really did it.

912
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
 He tested them with the knowledge of Vedic Dharma and gave them a fight.

913
00:29:05 --> 00:29:10
 He gave a fight to the people who gave the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

914
00:29:10 --> 00:29:17
 So, the Buddha taught us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma.

915
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
 Why did Buddha teach us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma?

916
00:29:19 --> 00:29:23
 We are not even talking about Hinduism.

917
00:29:23 --> 00:29:27
 Why did Buddha teach us the knowledge of Vedic Dharma?

918
00:29:27 --> 00:29:29
 Yes, Swami.

919
00:29:29 --> 00:29:31
 Thank you, Swami.

920
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
 Thank you, Swami.

921
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
 Okay.

922
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
 Even the Gopis who were taught by Lord Krishna when they were young,

923
00:29:41 --> 00:29:43
 they were taken care of by the people.

924
00:29:43 --> 00:29:47
 Yes, but they have names like Lalitha, Swati, Vishaka.

925
00:29:47 --> 00:29:49
 Vishaka.

926
00:29:49 --> 00:29:51
 They were raised by Lord Krishna.

927
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
 They were raised by Lord Krishna.

928
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
 Yes, Krishna was raised by Lord Krishna.

929
00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
 He was also of age.

930
00:29:57 --> 00:01:31
 So, the language is very strong.

931
00:01:31 --> 00:01:32
 The language is very strong.

932
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33

934
00:01:34 --> 00:01:35

936
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
 The language is very strong.

937
00:01:37 --> 00:01:38
 The language is very strong.

938
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
 The language is very strong.

939
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
 The language is very strong.

940
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
 The language is very strong.

941
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
 The language is very strong.

942
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
 The language is very strong.

943
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
 The language is very strong.

944
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
 The language is very strong.

945
00:01:45 --> 00:01:46
 The language is very strong.

946
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
 The language is very strong.

947
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
 The language is very strong.

948
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
 The language is very strong.

949
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
 The language is very strong.

950
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
 The language is very strong.

951
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
 The language is very strong.

952
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
 The language is very strong.

953
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
 The language is very strong.

954
00:01:54 --> 00:01:55
 The language is very strong.

955
00:01:55 --> 00:01:56
 The language is very strong.

956
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
 The language is very strong.

957
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
 The language is very strong.

958
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
 The language is very strong.

959
00:02:00 --> 00:02:01
 The language is very strong.

960
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
 The language is very strong.

961
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
 The language is very strong.

962
00:02:03 --> 00:02:04
 The language is very strong.

963
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
 The language is very strong.

964
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
 The language is very strong.

965
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
 The language is very strong.

966
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08

969
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
 The language is very strong.

970

 The language is very strong.

978
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
 The language is very strong.

984
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
 The language is very strong.

985
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
 Did she do it?

986
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
 Did she do it?

987
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
 Yes.

988
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
 Yes.

989
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
 Two tests are All right

990
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
 Yes.

991
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
 맹 Yes.

992
00:02:34 --> 00:02:35
 We It's called Govinda.

993
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
 Govinda test.

994
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
 And now we have gotten exam result.

995
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
 Now we have got exam result.

996
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
 Let's give a group test for each A.

997
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
 What will be the average score for trump card,

998
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
 Venus,

999
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
 And it's a good result.

1000
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
 But the two tests are all right.

1001
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
 So are

1002
00:02:51 --> 00:03:58
 How he touched others' lives.

1003
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
 Donation pariksha.

1004
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
 They actually fail.

1005
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
 See, everybody will raise objection when all the candidates fail in their test.

1006
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
 Then people with some questions must be tough or out of syllabus.

1007
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
 But he did not raise that failed test, objection to the failed test.

1008
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
 The test in which all pass, to that he is raising objection.

1009
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
 Pariksha.

1010
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
 Why he passed?

1011
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
 Passed, all passed.

1012
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
 First class.

1013
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
 First class, distinct class.

1014
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
 Not, 100 out of 100.

1015
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
 You got it right.

1016
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
 But he is asking why, why he has asked.

1017
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
 Because he is also a soul.

1018
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
 He knows the easiness of this test, difficulty of this.

1019
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
 Suppose he is asked to face the putreshana and dhanesha test.

1020
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
 He also failed.

1021
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
 That is why he kept silent.

1022
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
 Every soul will fail.

1023
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
 That is not the right answer.

1024
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
 This everybody will pass.

1025
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
 There he attacked.

1026
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
 So he wanted to be over smart.

1027
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
 Yes, over smart.

1028
00:05:01 --> 00:05:06
 So that is the very pariksha question itself is meaningless.

1029
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
 He should have raised the failed test.

1030
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
 See, in this all failed.

1031
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
 Question paper must be tough.

1032
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
 Question paper must contain very difficult questions.

1033
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
 Or out of syllabus questions.

1034
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
 Like that he should raise the failed test.

1035
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
 But he raised the objection about the pass test.

1036
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
 In which every candidate got 100 out of 100.

1037
00:05:27 --> 00:05:31
 He raised the subjection on that.

1038
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
 So his question itself is meaningless.

1039
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
 You gave a wonderful example of examiner and a doctor doing delivery.

1040
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
 Yes, yes.

1041
00:05:43 --> 00:05:44
 He did it.

1042
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
 See, who ran for the examination?

1043
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
 The teacher did not run.

1044
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
 Examiner did not.

1045
00:05:50 --> 00:05:57
 Students in the Amavatha or Incarnation Rama, they went and asked you to test that dhanesha.

1046
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
 They did not ask for dhanesha and putreshana.

1047
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
 Because they thought, that is very easy test.

1048
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
 Everybody will pass.

1049
00:06:03 --> 00:06:07
 That is very difficult test.

1050
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
 But all failed in dhanesha and putreshana only.

1051
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
 These judges thought that is very difficult test.

1052
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
 You please test.

1053
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
 No, no, no, that is very easy test.

1054
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
 Everybody will pass.

1055
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
 Be born as a real good guy.

1056
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
 Then I will put all the three tests.

1057
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
 Final examination.

1058
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
 Final examination contains four syllabus.

1059
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
 Tangible examination.

1060
00:06:31 --> 00:06:32
 Quarterly examination syllabus.

1061
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
 Half year examination syllabus.

1062
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
 Plus third term.

1063
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
 Total three strongest ones.

1064
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
 Yes, testing.

1065
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
 Correct.

1066
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
 So there he is the examiner.

1067
00:06:45 --> 00:06:51
 He is not seeker of knowledge.

1068
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
 He is asking questions to you for the correct answers.

1069
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
 You are thinking that he does not know the answer.

1070
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
 And he is asking you.

1071
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
 He wants to learn from you.

1072
00:07:01 --> 00:07:08
 As examiner, he is concentrating only on the examination.

1073
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
 Examination system.

1074
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
 Pass or fail.

1075
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
 Only he is concentrating on that.

1076
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
 Not on this romance.

1077
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
 For that I gave that example of doctor in olden days.

1078
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
 Male doctors, female doctors were not there.

1079
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
 Sometime back.

1080
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
 When a female undergoes delivery has to give birth to a child.

1081
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
 Male doctors used to do the delivery.

1082
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
 Sometime back.

1083
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
 Some generations.

1084
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
 That his concentration is only on the delivery of the child.

1085
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
 Without any harm to the mother and the child.

1086
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
 The child should come out.

1087
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
 And so that they will pay the fees.

1088
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
 Also they will respect.

1089
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
 They will thank him.

1090
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
 That is his concentration.

1091
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
 As examiner he is testing the Dhaneshana, Sushreshana and Dhaneshana.

1092
00:08:02 --> 00:08:08
 When he is delivering the child, you think you are touching the private parts of that lady.

1093
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
 So you have some romantic feeling.

1094
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
 It is a diversion.

1095
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
 He is not.

1096
00:08:14 --> 00:08:18
 If he is concentrating on that and the delivery fails.

1097
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
 Then he will be scolded.

1098
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
 He will be beaten.

1099
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
 He will not be given fees.

1100
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
 So Krishna's concentration is on the test.

1101
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
 Not for romance.

1102
00:08:31 --> 00:08:36
 If he wants romance, the heaven angels will come in queue.

1103
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
 He can create the most unimaginable, beautiful lady.

1104
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
 He himself can create.

1105
00:08:44 --> 00:08:51
 Narayana, when he made a line on his lap.

1106
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
 Like this.

1107
00:08:53 --> 00:08:55
 Uruvasi came from there.

1108
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
 Uru.

1109
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
 Uru means lap.

1110
00:08:58 --> 00:09:03
 From the lap, Uruvasi was born.

1111
00:09:03 --> 00:09:08
 So does he want romance?

1112
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
 And he was lying on milk ocean.

1113
00:09:12 --> 00:09:20
 Does he steal milk?

1114
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
 He was having only the examiner attitude.

1115
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
 Because in Ramavatar they pressured him like anything.

1116
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
 That is why as soon as he was born, he conducted those tests.

1117
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
 That is the primary work of his incarnation.

1118
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
 Tapasamsthaapana is everywhere.

1119
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
 In every avatar it is done.

1120
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
 Macha avatar, Kuma, Narasimha avatar.

1121
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
 Everywhere it is done.

1122
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
 This is a very special case.

1123
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
 Very delicate thing.

1124
00:09:48 --> 00:09:53
 Since he conducted that examination, gave the results correctly.

1125
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
 That is why he is called as Paripurna avatar.

1126
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
 Very difficult to understand.

1127
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
 Otherwise the god will be blamed.

1128
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
 There is every possibility of blaming the god.

1129
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
 That he conducted very correctly.

1130
00:10:11 --> 00:10:16
 And before conducting that test, he also showed several miracles.

1131
00:10:16 --> 00:10:21
 Telling that I am god, don't imitate.

1132
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
 Nobody shall imitate.

1133
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
 He lifted the Govardhana mountain with his finger.

1134
00:10:28 --> 00:10:37
 So that is why when I wrote gopik, I told them to put Krishna with mountain on this finger.

1135
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
 So that if anybody comes, I am Krishna.

1136
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
 Lift the mountain.

1137
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
 Then they will say, Adyatriya.

1138
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
 Very beautiful.

1139
00:10:49 --> 00:10:56
 I will come later on.

1140
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
 Not Adyatriya.

1141
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
 There also you are showing the other.

1142
00:11:02 --> 00:11:09
 So all the meaning is foolishness.

1143
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
 That is why Narayani Bhakshasutra's wrote,

1144
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
 Na Tatrapi.

1145
00:11:15 --> 00:11:24
 All gopikas know that he is god.

1146
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
 That is why they danced with him.

1147
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
 They don't have ignorance.

1148
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
 They know that he is god.

1149
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
 That is why they danced with him.

1150
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
 Next sutra.

1151
00:11:40 --> 00:11:50
 If that recognition of god about Krishna is not there in gopikas, then they will go to hell.

1152
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
 That is the sin.

1153
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
 They must go to hell.

1154
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
 Krishna will not go to hell.

1155
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
 Because he is only examining.

1156
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
 You cannot say Krishna should go to hell.

1157
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
 Actually both should go to hell.

1158
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
 In the case of human being.

1159
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
 Violating the rule.

1160
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
 He is not doing with that view.

1161
00:12:13 --> 00:12:26
 If these people, if these gopikas did dance with him with that view, with sinful view, with lust, hormonal provoked lust.

1162
00:12:26 --> 00:12:30
 Then Tadjihira Jaraana Vivaad. They will go to hell.

1163
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
 That is not their attitude.

1164
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
 Because intention is devotion.

1165
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
 Intention is not lust.

1166
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
 Why lust will be there? They are sages.

1167
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
 Even heavenly dancers when they came, they cursed them.

1168
00:12:47 --> 00:12:53
 Their penance was not disturbed by Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka, Kilotama.

1169
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
 They cursed them.

1170
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
 They won.

1171
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
 They burned their lust in penance fire.

1172
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
 How they can have lust?

1173
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
 They have devotion.

1174
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
 Only due to devotion they danced with him.

1175
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
 So when intention, intention only brings the result to action.

1176
00:13:14 --> 00:13:22
 Suppose a father hugs his own daughter and kisses daughter due to his love on the issue.

1177
00:13:22 --> 00:13:29
 And same lady, suppose a rapist rowdy comes and hugs and kisses her.

1178
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
 Same action in both cases?

1179
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
 Accuracy.

1180
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
 But here father is appreciated for his love to say yield.

1181
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
 There he goes to hell.

1182
00:13:40 --> 00:13:44
 Even the government courts they will punish him.

1183
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
 Even here as well as there he will be punished.

1184
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
 But same action.

1185
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
 Why this difference in the result of good?

1186
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
 Because intention is different.

1187
00:13:54 --> 00:13:59
 So their intention is not lust because they are sages.

1188
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
 They have already burned their lust in the penance fire.

1189
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
 Their intention is only devotion to God.

1190
00:14:05 --> 00:14:10
 Just like the father hugging his own issue.

1191
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
 Like that devotion only.

1192
00:14:12 --> 00:14:19
 Like that.

1193
00:14:19 --> 00:14:25
 Those two sutras are meant for this.

1194
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
 Jara vacha.

1195
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
 How you should love God?

1196
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
 What intensity of love you should be after God?

1197
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
 Then he searches for an example in the whole world.

1198
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
 What example he got in Narada Sages?

1199
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
 In Narada?

1200
00:14:49 --> 00:14:57
 A lady having illegal relationship with somebody.

1201
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
 How much she loves that illegal fellow?

1202
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
 Such love you should love God.

1203
00:15:05 --> 00:15:10
 See intensity, no better example he found.

1204
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
 One day one fellow came to my father.

1205
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
 My father is an astrologer.

1206
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
 Very famous in anthropology.

1207
00:15:17 --> 00:15:25
 He told my father, sir, your name is increasing, your fame is increasing like sin.

1208
00:15:25 --> 00:15:32
 His intention is not to appreciate only my father.

1209
00:15:32 --> 00:15:39
 As sin is increasing very fastly, your fame is increasing.

1210
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
 So even though it is a bad example, but in the intensity that is the highest example.

1211
00:15:45 --> 00:15:52
 Whenever a simile is given, you need not touch the simile in all aspects.

1212
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
 Your face is like moon.

1213
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
 Face is like moon only in one aspect.

1214
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
 Your face is present as the moon.

1215
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
 Not in all other aspects.

1216
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
 Moon has black dots.

1217
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
 Your face is black.

1218
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
 Moon grows in the Shukla Patsha.

1219
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
 In Amavasya it disappears.

1220
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
 Your face doesn't grow.

1221
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
 Moon is eclipsed by Rahu and Tethu.

1222
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
 Your face is not eclipsed by Rahu and Tethu.

1223
00:16:22 --> 00:16:28
 Only one quality simile is taken that is called as Ekabhagopama.

1224
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
 Ekabhagopama, only one aspect.

1225
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
 That is the intensity.

1226
00:16:34 --> 00:16:39
 The intensity of love there is the highest.

1227
00:16:39 --> 00:16:43
 Only for that intensity point he has given the example.

1228
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
 Because it is Ekabhagopama.

1229
00:16:45 --> 00:16:50
 It did not have other properties or similars in other properties.

1230
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
 That is Purnopama.

1231
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
 This is Ekabhagopama.

1232
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
 And for that I give a story also.

1233
00:16:59 --> 00:17:06
 King Bhoja came in disguise to see how the people are living in his kingdom.

1234
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11
 He sat on the Arugantara Baita.

1235
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
 There he sat.

1236
00:17:14 --> 00:17:22
 That lady, that family lady, a crow came and sounded ka ka like that.

1237
00:17:22 --> 00:17:27
 The lady was afraid and ran into the house.

1238
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
 What is this?

1239
00:17:29 --> 00:17:34
 For crow sound she feared and ran into the house.

1240
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
 Something must be there.

1241
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
 Let me observe what happens.

1242
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
 He slept in the night outside the house.

1243
00:17:42 --> 00:17:49
 Then in the midnight she made her husband to sleep.

1244
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
 Took Laja.

1245
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
 Laja means Murmuru.

1246
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
 Two puffed rice.

1247
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
 Two hands.

1248
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
 And she left the house in the midnight.

1249
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
 Went to Narmada river.

1250
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
 She crossed the Narmada river.

1251
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
 In Narmada the crocodiles are more.

1252
00:18:13 --> 00:18:19
 So she puts one handful Murmuru.

1253
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
 The crocodiles will go to catch those.

1254
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
 Then she will cross.

1255
00:18:24 --> 00:18:29
 Then she spent the time with her illegal relationship.

1256
00:18:29 --> 00:18:34
 And returning back the second handful rice to cross the Narmada river.

1257
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
 Per crocodiles.

1258
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
 This is Bhujah.

1259
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
 Next day he came to the court.

1260
00:18:40 --> 00:18:41
 Sabha.

1261
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
 Then he gave a tamasya.

1262
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
 Tamasya means

1263
00:18:47 --> 00:18:56
 A lady was frightened with the sound of crow in the daytime.

1264
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
 He gave the tamasya.

1265
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
 First line.

1266
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
 Nobody could understand this.

1267
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
 Only Kali Asa could understand.

1268
00:19:05 --> 00:19:07
 Kali Asa is a student.

1269
00:19:07 --> 00:19:10
 After Narmada river.

1270
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
 She crossed the Narmada river in the night time.

1271
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
 Then Bhujah told the third line.

1272
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
 Atrasanti jale graha.

1273
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
 But in Narmada river several crocodiles are present.

1274
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
 Talaja saiva sundari.

1275
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
 She has two.

1276
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
 In the two both hands she has a pocket knife.

1277
00:19:31 --> 00:19:41
 That is how he has taken that example for intensity.

1278
00:19:41 --> 00:19:48
 Because there in illegal relationship there is obstruction.

1279
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
 No it is not good.

1280
00:19:49 --> 00:19:50
 You should not do.

1281
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
 Then intensity will increase.

1282
00:19:52 --> 00:19:54
 Somebody says it is not good.

1283
00:19:54 --> 00:19:55
 Don't go there.

1284
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
 Then I get the ingredients.

1285
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
 Somebody says it is good.

1286
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
 There is no anxiety.

1287
00:20:03 --> 00:20:06
 That is human tendency.

1288
00:20:06 --> 00:20:15
 So much background for bhakti.

1289
00:20:15 --> 00:20:17
 Madhura bhakti.

1290
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
 So much background.

1291
00:20:19 --> 00:20:31
 And finally I found the females their eyes have gone to the top of the head.

1292
00:20:31 --> 00:20:36
 And therefore Sravakya told you are a mad fellow.

1293
00:20:36 --> 00:20:39
 Stole in the hand of mad fellow.

1294
00:20:39 --> 00:20:42
 We don't know which side he will throw.

1295
00:20:42 --> 00:20:45
 Then he will throw this stone to which side.

1296
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
 One day you raise your madhura bhakti to sky.

1297
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
 And now you blasted it completely.

1298
00:20:52 --> 00:21:00
 I told you see by word, by mind that devotion is common to males and females.

1299
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06
 But they have this body cannot be surrendered to God because they are males.

1300
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
 Then they feel that females have that facility.

1301
00:21:10 --> 00:21:12
 They don't have that facility.

1302
00:21:12 --> 00:21:19
 Then I told you compare Gopika's surrendering bodies to Krishna, God.

1303
00:21:19 --> 00:21:26
 You compare monkeys surrendering their bodies in the war on behalf of Rama.

1304
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
 Prepare for torture with the opposite weapons and prepare for death.

1305
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
 The Gopika's surrendered bodies for getting some pleasure.

1306
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
 Atmarastha kamaya sarvam priya bhagati.

1307
00:21:38 --> 00:21:40
 That is already told.

1308
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
 They got some pleasure from God.

1309
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
 But here there is no pleasure.

1310
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
 Death will come.

1311
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
 And torture will come with the opposite weapons.

1312
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
 So what are Gopika's before those monkeys?

1313
00:21:56 --> 00:22:06
 I am directly told you are a mad fellow.

1314
00:22:06 --> 00:22:13
 Your knowledge is like a stone present in the hand of a mad fellow.

1315
00:22:13 --> 00:22:18
 You don't know to which direction he will throw, to which side he will throw.

1316
00:22:18 --> 00:22:20
 Nobody knows.

1317
00:22:20 --> 00:22:26
 One day you put the masarabhakti at the top most.

1318
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
 That is Goloka.

1319
00:22:28 --> 00:22:34
 Higher than Brahma Loka is given to Gopika.

1320
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
 So higher than highest fruit.

1321
00:22:37 --> 00:22:39
 Like that you raise it.

1322
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
 I raise it as long as the eyes are in this area.

1323
00:22:44 --> 00:22:52
 But when the eyes go there, I must bring it down the ice.

1324
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
 Recent thing, recent knowledge.

1325
00:22:58 --> 00:22:59
 Yes sir.

1326
00:22:59 --> 00:23:00
 I got that.

1327
00:23:00 --> 00:23:04
 Initially you said that madhura bhakti is very much misunderstood.

1328
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
 That is why I raised.

1329
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
 Because in initial stage it was misunderstood.

1330
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
 It is one of the best ways.

1331
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
 It is one of the best ways.

1332
00:23:14 --> 00:23:17
 That does not mean other best ways are not present.

1333
00:23:17 --> 00:23:22
 See gold medals from various departments are equal.

1334
00:23:22 --> 00:23:27
 In history department you got gold medal, in politics department you got gold medal.

1335
00:23:27 --> 00:23:29
 Both are equal.

1336
00:23:29 --> 00:23:37
 So Brahma Loka, Goloka and Dattasevaka Loka, these three are equal.

1337
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
 Gold medalist from different departments.

1338
00:23:41 --> 00:24:03
 Like that Dattasevaka Loka is Arvajna.

1339
00:24:03 --> 00:24:07
 Arvajna means she knows everything.

1340
00:24:07 --> 00:24:12
 She knows how to raise the ego and how to down the ego.

1341
00:24:12 --> 00:24:19
 And that is always understood by everybody also.

1342
00:24:19 --> 00:24:20
 Yes.

1343
00:24:20 --> 00:24:27
 That is the fundamental characteristic of God Dattah.

1344
00:24:27 --> 00:24:33
 God Dattah, prajnana ghanaha is called as embodiment of knowledge.

1345
00:24:33 --> 00:24:36
 Solidified knowledge.

1346
00:24:36 --> 00:24:38
 Ghanah means solid.

1347
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
 See you cannot see the gaseous state.

1348
00:24:40 --> 00:24:44
 Liquid you can see but it is moving.

1349
00:24:44 --> 00:24:51
 But solid, standard, static you can see very clearly for a long time.

1350
00:24:51 --> 00:24:55
 So in solid state clarity is highest.

1351
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
 Standard also.

1352
00:24:58 --> 00:25:01
 That static in nature is always present.

1353
00:25:01 --> 00:25:02
 It is always static.

1354
00:25:02 --> 00:25:04
 It won't move.

1355
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
 It is more clear than liquid.

1356
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
 So he is called as prajnana ghanaha.

1357
00:25:12 --> 00:25:14
 The knowledge is solidified.

1358
00:25:14 --> 00:25:16
 He is God Dattah.

1359
00:25:16 --> 00:25:23
 Solidified means in his knowledge everywhere clarity will be the maximum.

1360
00:25:23 --> 00:25:30
 Without clarity what is the use of preaching?

1361
00:25:30 --> 00:25:39
 See when there is no clarity in the knowledge that means the preacher himself has no clarity about the subject.

1362
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
 He is confused.

1363
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
 He is not having clear knowledge about the topic which he is preaching to others.

1364
00:25:47 --> 00:25:53
 So like that clarity.

1365
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
 So that is the way of the knowledge.

1366
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
 What?

1367
00:25:57 --> 00:25:59
 So that is the way of the knowledge.

1368
00:25:59 --> 00:26:01
 So that is the way of the knowledge.

1369
00:26:01 --> 00:26:03
 Not only that Swami.

1370
00:26:03 --> 00:26:05
 Not only prajnana ghanaha.

1371
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
 That is the way of the knowledge.

1372
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
 That is the way of the knowledge.

1373
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
 That is the way of the knowledge.

1374
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
 That is the way of the knowledge.

1375
00:26:13 --> 00:26:15
 That is the way of the knowledge.

1376
00:26:15 --> 00:26:17
 That is the way of the knowledge.

1377
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
 That is the way of the knowledge.

1378
00:26:19 --> 00:26:21
 That is the way of the knowledge.

1379
00:26:21 --> 00:26:23
 Omnipotent.

1380
00:26:23 --> 00:26:25
 Actually one omnipotent is sufficient.

1381
00:26:25 --> 00:26:27
 That adjective is sufficient.

1382
00:26:27 --> 00:26:29
 Other things are not necessary.

1383
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
 Omnipotent means omniscient.

1384
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
 Omnipotent means without being omnipresent he is omniscient.

1385
00:26:37 --> 00:26:39
 That is due to omnipotence.

1386
00:26:39 --> 00:26:43
 So one adjective omnipotence is sufficient.

1387
00:26:43 --> 00:26:48
 Omnipresent and omniscient are not necessary.

1388
00:26:48 --> 00:26:53
 They are automatically resulting due to omnipotence.

1389
00:26:53 --> 00:26:58
 So that one adjective is sufficient.

1390
00:26:58 --> 00:27:00
 Sarva Shittimavana.

1391
00:27:00 --> 00:27:09
 That is what the spiritual discussion between Ari Samajaya and Sanatana Dharma took place in Mahakumbhamela.

1392
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
 Yes Swami.

1393
00:27:11 --> 00:27:13
 There Karapatra Swami came.

1394
00:27:13 --> 00:27:17
 And the debate is going on for some five days.

1395
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
 Between Ari Samajaya and Sanatana Dharma.

1396
00:27:21 --> 00:27:24
 I closed the debate in five minutes.

1397
00:27:24 --> 00:27:30
 I just put one question to Ari Samajaya.

1398
00:27:30 --> 00:27:32
 Swarats.

1399
00:27:32 --> 00:27:34
 Ishwara Sarva Shittimavana?

1400
00:27:34 --> 00:27:38
 Because Vala is taken in Sanskrit language.

1401
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
 So I asked him.

1402
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
 Is God omnipotent or not?

1403
00:27:42 --> 00:27:46
 They say omnipotent.

1404
00:27:46 --> 00:27:47
 Ishwara Sarva Shittimavana.

1405
00:27:47 --> 00:27:49
 Even Ari Samajaya Dayanath Saraswati says.

1406
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
 Ishwara Sarva Shittimavana.

1407
00:27:51 --> 00:27:53
 Then?

1408
00:27:53 --> 00:27:56
 Is he, that means he possesses all powers.

1409
00:27:56 --> 00:28:00
 Then is he possessing the power to incarnate or not?

1410
00:28:00 --> 00:28:11
 He is possessing the power to incarnate.

1411
00:28:11 --> 00:28:14
 Then there should be no objection for his incarnation.

1412
00:28:14 --> 00:28:18
 If we say he is not, they are regressed incarnations.

1413
00:28:18 --> 00:28:23
 If he says he is not having that power, then he cannot be omnipotent.

1414
00:28:23 --> 00:28:27
 All powers present except that one power.

1415
00:28:27 --> 00:28:29
 99 powers are present.

1416
00:28:29 --> 00:28:30
 100 are not present.

1417
00:28:30 --> 00:28:31
 One is less.

1418
00:28:31 --> 00:28:33
 Then how he can be omnipotent?

1419
00:28:33 --> 00:28:40
 Then he told.

1420
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
 No, no, he is omnipotent.

1421
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
 But he is not taking the incarnation.

1422
00:28:46 --> 00:28:49
 Not unable to take the incarnation.

1423
00:28:49 --> 00:28:52
 But he does not want to take incarnation.

1424
00:28:52 --> 00:28:54
 Like that she said.

1425
00:28:54 --> 00:28:56
 Then I told.

1426
00:28:56 --> 00:28:58
 The devotees are praying for the incarnation.

1427
00:28:58 --> 00:29:04
 They want to have Sambhashana, Darshan, Darshan, Sambhashana, Sahavata.

1428
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
 They are praying.

1429
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
 And God is very kind.

1430
00:29:08 --> 00:29:10
 Devotees are praying for that.

1431
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
 Why you are standing in between God and the devotees?

1432
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
 Like Andhika Narbhavati.

1433
00:29:18 --> 00:29:24
 He has the power to incarnate.

1434
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
 They are praying him to incarnate.

1435
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
 They want to see him.

1436
00:29:30 --> 00:29:32
 They want to talk with him.

1437
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36
 They want to touch him by doing Pada Namaskaram.

1438
00:29:36 --> 00:29:38
 They want to live with him.

1439
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
 They are praying.

1440
00:29:40 --> 00:29:42
 And he has that power.

1441
00:29:42 --> 00:29:46
 Why should we object like a priest between God and a devotee?

1442
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
 Pujya is much more elevated today.

1443
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
 Why do you object?

1444
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
 There is a need.

1445
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
 High, very high devotees.

1446
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
 They are praying.

1447
00:29:58 --> 00:00:07
 for that. They want that. He is capable of that. Will he refuse the desire of...on what

1448
00:00:07 --> 00:00:16
 basis he is refusing? Suppose you say he is refusing, for what purpose? Meaningless. Closing.

1449
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
 Topic is closing.

1450
00:00:19 --> 00:00:32
 Is he omnipotent or not? They don't know what I am going to play next year. They told,

1451
00:00:32 --> 00:00:42
 hey, he is Omnipotent. All the four or five scholars, they shouted, he is Omnipotent.

1452
00:00:42 --> 00:00:49
 Then is he having the potency, power to incarnate or not? If you say that he has no power to

1453
00:00:49 --> 00:00:56
 incarnate, he is not Saraswati Maam. He is not having all powers. All powers but except

1454
00:00:56 --> 00:01:03
 one power. That will not be Omnipotency. If you say that he has the power, there is a

1455
00:01:03 --> 00:01:10
 need devotees are praying, requesting. He is very kind Lord. He is very kind to devotees.

1456
00:01:10 --> 00:01:20
 He always do...he will do anything for the sake of devotees. Such a need is there and

1457
00:01:20 --> 00:01:27
 he is potent, he is capable. Why you are objecting in between? Why you are standing in between

1458
00:01:27 --> 00:01:34
 the two? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting?

1459
00:01:34 --> 00:01:41
 Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why

1460
00:01:41 --> 00:01:48
 you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not

1461
00:01:48 --> 00:01:55
 objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting? Why you are not objecting?

1462
00:01:55 --> 00:02:05
 Then, Tharpatra Swamiji, he was so much pleased with me. He embraced me and told, I will give

1463
00:02:05 --> 00:02:13
 sanyasa to you. You become the Peethasapati of Kashi Peetham. Kashi Shankara Peetham is

1464
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
 the master of all the other four Peethas. Because Shankaracharya written Bhashya commentaries

1465
00:02:19 --> 00:02:29
 only in Kashi. Then the Peethas, Tharpatra Swamiji, he is the author, he is Gita Hibbati.

1466
00:02:29 --> 00:02:37
 As successor. Then I wrote to my father. Such a good opportunity came.

1467
00:02:37 --> 00:02:52
 Age of 16, 17. 16 completed. Then my father wrote, you stop that education, come back

1468
00:02:52 --> 00:03:00
 to home. I will not agree to you to take sanyasa because you are my eldest son. Eldest son is

1469
00:03:00 --> 00:03:07
 responsible for all the pitrukarmas and the parents by. He is the aggigari actually. Tharpatra

1470
00:03:07 --> 00:03:14
 is only eldest son. The other brothers only just they follow, they assist only. They just

1471
00:03:14 --> 00:03:24
 follow only. The main tharpatra is the jesta putraha. The first eldest son. Objected. Then

1472
00:03:24 --> 00:03:42
 I dropped from that idea. Then I wept for that. Then God that I appeared and told why

1473
00:03:42 --> 00:03:50
 you are weak. I beseeched that golden chance. Moreover I studied this bloody science in

1474
00:03:50 --> 00:03:57
 which I am not interested. I am interested in Sanskrit and philosophy. He did not allow

1475
00:03:57 --> 00:04:05
 me to go in that line. He brought me in this science line which I don't like at all. I

1476
00:04:05 --> 00:04:12
 like only philosophy and Sanskrit. Why you force me into this line? Then he told, he

1477
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
 gave the explanation. Transcript you have studied in every previous birth you are a

1478
00:04:18 --> 00:04:27
 science. Now the need is you have to teach the philosophy, spiritual knowledge to scientists,

1479
00:04:27 --> 00:04:39
 not the Sanskrit scholars. The whole world is full of scientists. Even arts subjects

1480
00:04:39 --> 00:04:46
 also can be called science, political science like that, social science. So science is everywhere.

1481
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
 So you must study science. You have to preach spiritual knowledge to scientists, not to

1482
00:04:51 --> 00:04:58
 old Sanskrit scholars. There are no Sanskrit scholars also now. Very little. Very countable

1483
00:04:58 --> 00:05:06
 on fingers. Minor thing. That is why I made you to study science. Actually since I studied

1484
00:05:06 --> 00:05:13
 science, I could tell that the trees do not have awareness, nervous system and brain.

1485
00:05:13 --> 00:05:20
 They have only respiration. Pranam ekosha. Taking oxygen limit on the life. It is not

1486
00:05:20 --> 00:05:26
 real awareness of life. Not real life. It is called as life. Pranam ekosha. But not

1487
00:05:26 --> 00:05:33
 Manom ekosha. They are not undergoing pain. See this answer I could give only because

1488
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
 I studied botany, Geology, Chemistry, B.Sc.

1489
00:05:36 --> 00:05:59
 They have life. Yes. Even now we eat non-Hindutians. But see Boer's theory was not accepted by

1490
00:05:59 --> 00:06:07
 all world scientists. He was not accepted by several scientists. He was not accepted.

1491
00:06:07 --> 00:06:16
 See life means, you take life means only respiration which is a mechanical process. It has no awareness.

1492
00:06:16 --> 00:06:23
 Trees are living beings. Animals are also living beings. But animals are living beings with

1493
00:06:23 --> 00:06:33
 awareness. Trees are living beings without awareness. Life that, what are the life there

1494
00:06:33 --> 00:06:44
 means only mechanical respiration process. It is not nervous system and brain. See real

1495
00:06:44 --> 00:06:55
 life is awareness. Not the mechanical respiration. See we can prepare life system in the laboratory.

1496
00:06:55 --> 00:07:02
 You can take a chemical reaction taking place in your vessel. You can send oxygen through

1497
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
 one tube. That reaction takes place. Carbon dioxide is emitted. That you can take out

1498
00:07:07 --> 00:07:14
 from one tube. You have created pranamaya question elaborated it. But you cannot create

1499
00:07:14 --> 00:07:22
 awareness. You cannot create awareness. By any experiment you cannot create awareness.

1500
00:07:22 --> 00:07:30
 Swami a person in coma state is as good as a plant. Can we consider that? Good as plant

1501
00:07:30 --> 00:07:36
 means his brain nervous system is not working. That is why he is in coma state. Like a plant.

1502
00:07:36 --> 00:07:44
 Like a plant. It is called vegetative state. Provided he is taking respiration. On ventilation.

1503
00:07:44 --> 00:07:51
 Even on ventilation. Swami for human beings and animals. Here the point is respiration

1504
00:07:51 --> 00:07:59
 is in plants. Respiration is in animals also. But in addition to respiration there is a

1505
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
 nervous system in animals. That nervous system is the absentee plants.

1506
00:08:03 --> 00:08:11
 Then I asked from Mahabharata Swami. Adat Dhargabhubhav debate is there. And they said there are

1507
00:08:11 --> 00:08:17
 senses in the plants. Then you have to admit that. In fact they are the interpolated.

1508
00:08:17 --> 00:08:26
 Adat you see in the instructions. Somebody will say Parvati Vasa, Shiva Bhuvasa. Parvati

1509
00:08:26 --> 00:08:33
 told like this in Tantra Granthas. Always Shiva Bhuvasa, Parvati Vasa. Like that. In

1510
00:08:33 --> 00:08:43
 the name of Parvati and Shiva they write. Then it will be accepted. Parvati also Shiva

1511
00:08:43 --> 00:08:55
 Bhuvasa. Must be. That is incessance. That you need not worry. Have you taken audio video

1512
00:08:55 --> 00:09:11
 cassette. Then Parvati asked and Shiva replied. So science helped me in that way. See while

1513
00:09:11 --> 00:09:18
 telling the human incarnation has both human nature as well as the God's nature, divine

1514
00:09:18 --> 00:09:25
 nature. I took the example electron. Electron has both wave nature and particle nature.

1515
00:09:25 --> 00:09:37
 Dual nature of electron. Human incarnation I compared to the single phase system in which

1516
00:09:37 --> 00:09:42
 two components are present. God component, human being component. But phase is single.

1517
00:09:42 --> 00:09:49
 Human being only is seen. God component is not seen. So single phase in which two components

1518
00:09:49 --> 00:09:56
 are present. See gold and copper are mixed. But it looks as gold only. 22 carats gold

1519
00:09:56 --> 00:10:01
 looks like gold. Unless you put microscope and see gold atoms are different from copper

1520
00:10:01 --> 00:10:10
 atoms. Spectrograph like that. So therefore while giving examples I could give many scientific

1521
00:10:10 --> 00:10:18
 examples. Because I studied science. That is in Baha. That free energy explanation.

1522
00:10:18 --> 00:10:33
 And that first law of thermodynamics also. Q is equal to delta E plus W. And reaction

1523
00:10:33 --> 00:10:48
 is the slowest step. Slowest step of the reaction determines the whole time of the reaction.

1524
00:10:48 --> 00:10:55
 Then once knowledge is obtained the bhakti is spontaneous. Karma yoga is spontaneous.

1525
00:10:55 --> 00:11:02
 So the first step took 10 minutes. The other three steps are spontaneous. They took 10

1526
00:11:02 --> 00:11:10
 minutes one second. In one second the other three steps are completed. So the overall

1527
00:11:10 --> 00:11:16
 reaction time is only 10 minutes. The time taken by the first step is the overall time

1528
00:11:16 --> 00:11:23
 of the entire reaction. That is why he told. Gyanarayam adh kaiwayam. By spiritual knowledge

1529
00:11:23 --> 00:11:28
 you will get kaiwayam. That means when you get full spiritual knowledge automatically

1530
00:11:28 --> 00:11:33
 spontaneously you get devotion. Spontaneously you will get practical devotion. Spontaneously

1531
00:11:33 --> 00:11:42
 you will get fruit. The first step is very difficult. Slowest step. Acquiring the correct

1532
00:11:42 --> 00:11:51
 and complete knowledge. So Gyanarayam adh kaiwayam. It can be supported. It does not

1533
00:11:51 --> 00:11:56
 mean that theoretical devotion, practical devotion and fruit are absent. Strictly the

1534
00:11:56 --> 00:12:03
 Gnana is giving the final product. The second step and third step are spontaneous. Their

1535
00:12:03 --> 00:12:09
 time is not considered at all. It looks as soon as the first step of the reaction is

1536
00:12:09 --> 00:12:17
 over the fruit has come. It looks like that. So Gyanarayam adh kaiwayam is justified. That

1537
00:12:17 --> 00:12:31
 is why Shankara told like that. I could support Shankara by the reaction kind things. That

1538
00:12:31 --> 00:12:39
 is why then he also told the reason for him to obstruct me from the sanyasa, becoming

1539
00:12:39 --> 00:12:46
 Kashi Peethasipathy. He told the reason is if you become Kashi Peethasipathy only some

1540
00:12:46 --> 00:12:53
 four or five Sanskrit scholars will become to you. And as Shankara Peethasipathy you

1541
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59
 cannot support Ramayana Maddha etc. You have to support only Shankara. You have to always

1542
00:12:59 --> 00:13:08
 scold Ramayana Maddha. That is the rule of the Peetham. Is it not? So how can you propagate

1543
00:13:08 --> 00:13:16
 the universal spirituality? In Hinduism itself you cannot oppose the sub religions. How can

1544
00:13:16 --> 00:13:27
 you unite the religions of the entire world? That is why he stopped now. Gyanarayam thought

1545
00:13:27 --> 00:13:36
 he will do all for his work. Maybe he is very attentive in his work. But when we ask some

1546
00:13:36 --> 00:13:50
 fruit then he will become angry. His work he is very alert. If you ask salary he will

1547
00:13:50 --> 00:14:03
 become irritated. If you show interest in his work he will very much believe. Not like

1548
00:14:03 --> 00:14:17
 that. He has given lot of money. Lot of unimaginable amount he has given. Because he never tells

1549
00:14:17 --> 00:14:31
 a lie. That is the sentence told by him. Unimaginable amount. I should not speak because if the

1550
00:14:31 --> 00:14:49
 news goes to some income tax people I will be in trouble. So always I was going back.

1551
00:14:49 --> 00:14:58
 I will not do this full time. I will do some job. In leisure time I will do this. I am

1552
00:14:58 --> 00:15:03
 doing from the beginning like this only. Now what else I will do? I don't want anything

1553
00:15:03 --> 00:15:11
 for doing your work. I don't want any fruit from you for your work. I will work for my

1554
00:15:11 --> 00:15:18
 expenses, for my family expenses. I will work in the end. In leisure time I will dedicate

1555
00:15:18 --> 00:15:28
 to you. That is what I told. I thinking as if he doesn't have any money. He is a poor

1556
00:15:28 --> 00:15:36
 fellow. That is like see very difficult for you to pay. Let me earn my livelihood. I will

1557
00:15:36 --> 00:15:47
 do free service to you. You must do full time work. I will give in a different way. I will

1558
00:15:47 --> 00:15:58
 give in a different way. That is what he did. And he did it. He did it also not correctly.

1559
00:15:58 --> 00:16:07
 When he told the statement the whole nature rearranged to fulfill his statement. It is

1560
00:16:07 --> 00:16:16
 not his issue and did some work for that arrangement. When the sentence came from his mouth it has

1561
00:16:16 --> 00:16:31
 to be done by the nature. We always speak as per the situation. But when he speaks the

1562
00:16:31 --> 00:16:40
 situation follows his speech. Our speech will be following the situation. What is the actual

1563
00:16:40 --> 00:16:47
 going on? We will study and then speak accordingly. Our speech follows the situation whereas

1564
00:16:47 --> 00:16:54
 the situation follows his speech. That is the difference between God and soul.

1565
00:16:54 --> 00:17:20
 That is the real experience. Once the statement came from his mouth it will feel like anything.

1566
00:17:20 --> 00:17:31
 And the nature does the work with such a speed, tremendous speed. The work will be done with

1567
00:17:31 --> 00:17:40
 tremendous speed because he is the ultimate God. He is that unimaginable God. He expressed

1568
00:17:40 --> 00:17:47
 all fresh energetic incarnations. And the definition of God completely appraise in him.

1569
00:17:47 --> 00:17:55
 He is only one. He does creation, maintenance and destruction of the world. These two are

1570
00:17:55 --> 00:18:04
 the definitions of the God. Even Janmaadvishaya has Brahma Sutras. This is only given as definition.

1571
00:18:04 --> 00:18:11
 This definition of God contains two aspects, two points. One is he is one. He does all

1572
00:18:11 --> 00:18:18
 the three works, creation, ruling and destruction. These two points exactly visibly apply in

1573
00:18:18 --> 00:18:25
 him. He is one person only. So Hekmaadvishaya Brahma that apply. He is having three faces.

1574
00:18:25 --> 00:18:33
 With Brahma face he creates. With Vishnu face he rules. With Shiva face he destroys. Only

1575
00:18:33 --> 00:18:40
 one personality. He does all the three works. That is the definition of ultimate God. That

1576
00:18:40 --> 00:18:51
 is Brahma Jignasa. Brahma means ultimate God. That definition completely appraise in him.

1577
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
 That is why he told,

1578
00:18:53 --> 00:19:13
 According to Vedic definition, he is proved to be the ultimate God. This explanation has

1579
00:19:13 --> 00:19:25
 not come so far about that. They say that he is born from Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.

1580
00:19:25 --> 00:19:32
 That is also correct. But that incarnation is called as Dattaatreya. This is Datta. Datta

1581
00:19:32 --> 00:19:42
 appeared for Atreya and Anasuya. In Bhagavatam, in Rotsha mountain, both did long penance.

1582
00:19:42 --> 00:19:50
 And Datta appeared there. First Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva appeared. Atreya refused them. God is

1583
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
 only one. He may do all the three activities together. But God is not a board of directors

1584
00:19:56 --> 00:20:10
 of a company. He is only one. He refused all three. He refused. Then with three faces,

1585
00:20:10 --> 00:20:21
 single God Datta appeared. Then Anasuya asked him to take birth in her womb. Then Brahma

1586
00:20:21 --> 00:20:30
 born as Chandra, Vishnu born as Datta and Shiva born as Durvasa. Then Brahma and Shiva,

1587
00:20:30 --> 00:20:36
 they gave their powers. They gave all their divinities to the central Datta. And Chandra

1588
00:20:36 --> 00:20:43
 went and mixed with planets, Navagrahas. Durvasa went and mixed with sages. He is a

1589
00:20:43 --> 00:20:51
 Rishi. After losing their divinities, he became a planet, he became a sage. From that time

1590
00:20:51 --> 00:21:04
 Datta, Dattaatreya became Srimurcha. Not by birth. That is human incarnation. But this

1591
00:21:04 --> 00:21:10
 is the first energetic incarnation which appeared to Atreya and Anasuya before the

1592
00:21:10 --> 00:21:21
 birth of Dattaatreya. And since Anasuya requested, he is born as three sons. So Datta is different

1593
00:21:21 --> 00:21:28
 from Dattaatreya. Datta is the original energetic incarnation, ultimate God. Dattaatreya is his

1594
00:21:28 --> 00:21:40
 human incarnation. Datta is not the birth day of Datta. It is the birth day of Dattaatreya.

1595
00:21:40 --> 00:22:02
 They both are one. They merged with each other. They become one only. That is how every incarnation

1596
00:22:02 --> 00:22:13
 is. Unimaginable God enters every incarnation through God Datta. Because God Datta, Unimaginable

1597
00:22:13 --> 00:22:20
 God merged. And you need not refer to Unimaginable God because he is beyond imagination. How

1598
00:22:20 --> 00:22:33
 can you refer? Only you can refer him as the ultimate God. And here no Shaiva Matham and

1599
00:22:33 --> 00:22:39
 Vaishnava Matham. All these are absent. All the three are present. And the inertial Brahma

1600
00:22:39 --> 00:22:50
 is also added. It is three in one. Why should you leave Brahma? Who is the first form of

1601
00:22:50 --> 00:23:02
 God creating the world? Only Vishnu and Shiva. Only after Brahma, only Vishnu and Shiva came.

1602
00:23:02 --> 00:23:12
 First is Brahma. You have left Brahma completely. Nobody worships Brahma. So all these defects

1603
00:23:12 --> 00:23:29
 are rectified. But Vedantists follow that ultimate God as Nidakara, Nirguna, who cannot

1604
00:23:29 --> 00:23:38
 be even imagined. Bhagavad Gita says, avyatah gajar dukham deha vadhira vaapya te. If you

1605
00:23:38 --> 00:23:47
 worship that Nirguna Param Brahma, you will get misery, you will get dukha only. Because

1606
00:23:47 --> 00:23:56
 you cannot imagine even. How can you worship? When you can't imagine him, how can you worship?

1607
00:23:56 --> 00:24:04
 He is like a naked person in the bathroom. Nobody can see him. He only can see himself.

1608
00:24:04 --> 00:24:15
 That is God only knows God. Brahman knows only Brahman. Nobody other than him can see

1609
00:24:15 --> 00:24:24
 him. He is naked in the bathroom. Only he can see himself. He knows about himself. No

1610
00:24:24 --> 00:24:36
 other fellow can know him. So he became visible after dressing. That dressing is medium. He

1611
00:24:36 --> 00:24:44
 became mediated God, Saguna Brahma. That is Nirguna Brahma in the bathroom. Outside he

1612
00:24:44 --> 00:24:52
 came as Saguna Brahma. Even though he dressed, his face is seen, his palms are seen, legs

1613
00:24:52 --> 00:25:00
 are seen. Some original is also seen. Then what is that seen? We told he is unimaginable

1614
00:25:00 --> 00:25:12
 God. We are seeing his face, hands etc. What is that unimaginable expressed in God Datta?

1615
00:25:12 --> 00:25:20
 Miracles. Miracles. What are miracles? Unimaginable events. Indicating the source of unimaginable

1616
00:25:20 --> 00:25:32
 God. So unimaginable God is expressed through face, through hands, legs. Excellent. Excellent

1617
00:25:32 --> 00:25:40
 point. Because by the miracles only, the unimaginable God is indicated. Unimaginable God is the

1618
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
 source of unimaginable events called miracles.

1619
00:25:44 --> 00:25:52
 As far as I know, I was thinking that we are Vedant is that we follow Parabrahma, ultimate

1620
00:25:52 --> 00:26:00
 God. Parabrahman is monavyachya pravirata parabrahma ratnam, only silence. Because nothing

1621
00:26:00 --> 00:26:10
 is understood. As far as avyatta he is getting dukkham. We are not Vedant. In one song also

1622
00:26:10 --> 00:27:14
 we say that. We say that we are the Guru. He is the Guru Datta.

1623
00:27:14 --> 00:27:28
 So 9 is enough, 9 has passed. Then you all should go home.

1624
00:27:28 --> 00:27:38
 Swami spoke for 40 hours contribution to Gajar Mahara from Mumbai. He is now Swami

1625
00:27:38 --> 00:27:56
 Keshavadri. See, if I don't speak the knowledge, like gases trouble, it will pain.

1626
00:27:56 --> 00:28:08
 If I speak knowledge, then stomach is pain. My brain acts like a stomach. Like the stomach

1627
00:28:08 --> 00:28:20
 is upset by gas, the brain is upset by knowledge. I speak, then something. And release is there.

1628
00:28:20 --> 00:28:34
 So Krishna has to be well.

1629
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 Yes, Swami.

1630
00:28:36 --> 00:28:44
 All of you.

1631
00:28:44 --> 00:28:48
 Janakanna manna adhi na.

1632
00:28:48 --> 00:28:54
 Real Krishna has to be Swami today.

1633
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
 Gnanayeknam fire bathsvar.

1634
00:28:58 --> 00:29:08
 Starting only Swami said that only discussing of the spiritual knowledge itself is the real

1635
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
 festival. That's what could happen literally.

1636
00:29:12 --> 00:29:24
 That's what you started, same word you started Swami. That's what happened. The real festival

1637
00:29:24 --> 00:29:30
 happened. That is why he told Gnana Deepavali, Bhakti Deepavali. Deepavali is also Krishna's

1638
00:29:30 --> 00:29:34
 festival. But it should be Gnana Deepavali and Bhakti Deepavali. Gnana and Bhakti are

1639
00:29:34 --> 00:29:40
 one and the same. Because Gnana, I am hearing Gnana, you develop some inspiration on God.

1640
00:29:40 --> 00:29:47
 That inspiration is not different from Gnana. That is what Shankara told. In Gita actually

1641
00:29:47 --> 00:29:49
 two verses came.

1642
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
 Priyohi Gnani no atyantam. Gnani sachamav priya.

1643
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
 Another place, Bhaktas te ati mume priya.

1644
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
 Devotee is the highest in one place.

1645
00:30:00 --> 00:00:06
 In another place he told, Gnani is the highest.

1646
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
 Two superlatives cannot be for two objects.

1647
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
 Superlative is only for one object.

1648
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
 Then Shankara wrote, Paramantha Gnanalaksha Rasa Sampan Naam Bhakti Michyadha.

1649
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
 Gnana and bhakti both are one and the same.

1650
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
 So for the superlative only one example, one item came.

1651
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
 Gnana is not different from bhakti. Gnana produces bhakti.

1652
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
 Bhakti is inspiration, abstract.

1653
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
 It is always associated with Gnana.

1654
00:00:38 --> 00:00:44
 As you get more and more Gnana, the more and more bhakti will be generated.

1655
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
 So it is always associated with Gnana.

1656
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
 So it is considered as one item only.

1657
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
 That is why superlative is only one item.

1658
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
 Like that he wrote, Paramantha.

1659
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
 Because two things cannot be in one superlative.

1660
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
 Highest means only one.

1661
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
 So like that.

1662
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
 Gnana gives bhakti.

1663
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
 Thank you Swami.

1664
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
 Give it so much of love.

1665
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
 Lot of love.

1666
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
 Anyway I enjoyed.

1667
00:01:18 --> 00:01:24
 Very good. Krishnasami is celebrated in the best way.

1668
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
 Excellent.

1669
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
 Marvelous.

1670
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
 All points you covered.

1671
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
 Every point, all points.

1672
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
 Explanation is excellent.

1673
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
 Very beautiful.

1674
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
 Babu, naa chathayindha dhokkate.

1675
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
 Neekh okkadi gaya chathayindha dhokkate.

1676
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
 Neekh kabaddi gaya chathayindha dhokkate.

1677
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
 Neekh okkadi gaya chathayindha dhokkate.

1678
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
 Neekh kabaddi gaya chathayindha dhokkate.

1679
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
 That is also correct.

1680
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
 I can do only one.

1681
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
 One more.

1682
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
 Many thanks.

1683
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
 Namaste.

1684
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
 Janmanko Jyotiratim.

1685
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
 Janmanko Krishnashami.

1686
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
 Namaste.

1687
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
 That morning Ramachandra was telling

1688
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
 this was the first Krishnashami

1689
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
 and it was celebrated in online.

1690
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
 First Krishnashami.

1691
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
 First Krishnashami.

1692
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
 I told because of our distinguished guest Chanda.

1693
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
 I told because of our distinguished guest Chanda.

1694
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
 Very fast.

1695
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
 Online first Krishnashami.

1696
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
 Yes.

1697
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
 Excellent.

1698
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
 She graced the occasion with her physical presence.

1699
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
 She can recognize the Swamiji.

1700
00:02:44 --> 00:02:52
 I only speak the knowledge.

1701
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
 She practices the knowledge.

1702
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
 She is far far greater than me.

1703
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
 She is far far greater than me.

1704
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
 Because you preached only she could do Swamiji.

1705
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
 Because you preached only she could do Swamiji.

1706
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
 I only speak her.

1707
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
 Practicing it.

1708
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
 Because you preached it so

1709
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
 that she could practice it.

1710
00:03:10 --> 00:03:15
 See preaching is very easy but practicing is difficult.

1711
00:03:15 --> 00:03:30
 Swami has to receive the practical services because he has to test.

1712
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
 What you have understood has to be tested.

1713
00:03:33 --> 00:03:45
 I will borrow the words from Nikhil Sir Swami. He said when the preacher is of highest order like God Datta, then even the lowest soul will perform in a climax way.

1714
00:03:45 --> 00:03:51
 Excellent!

1715
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
 But the higher picture is the highest God Datta.

1716
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
 Practice is very difficult.

1717
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
 Kama Yoga is very difficult. That is the final step.

1718
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
 Excellent!

1719
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
 Everybody will learn knowledge. Everybody will get inspiration.

1720
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
 But nothing happens in practice.

1721
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
 Tuss in practice.

1722
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
 Among angels you are the highest. Among souls, Chanda Ji is the highest.

1723
00:04:24 --> 00:04:36
 She is not highest. I actually gave the comment, how she is possible.

1724
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
 That is the question which is not answered so far.

1725
00:04:40 --> 00:04:46
 She did all Kama Phalakyaaga. All her gold and all her cash.

1726
00:04:46 --> 00:04:53
 Then some two days back, she phoned to me and told, second time I want to Kama Phalakyaaga.

1727
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
 Whatever I have in my bank balance, I want to give.

1728
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
 Then she told, don't tell this to anybody.

1729
00:05:00 --> 00:05:08
 I am telling to everybody and also telling, all of you don't tell anything.

1730
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
 Like Ram Ram Rayaraj.

1731
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
 Telling that?

1732
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
 I am telling to everybody.

1733
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
 Please, all of you.

1734
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
 Don't tell anybody.

1735
00:05:23 --> 00:05:33
 Already our minds are blocked with the first shock.

1736
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
 Now she is prepared to be second time. Even before we are two different first time.

1737
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
 Okay sir.

1738
00:05:43 --> 00:05:55
 Come.

1739
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
 Once Swami told, secret is always to be told.

1740
00:05:59 --> 00:06:19
 I am also thinking that in this Kali Yuga, though it preach the whatever Krishna preach.

1741
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
 That the Kama Phalakyaaga, Kama Phalakyaaga, Bhakti Yoga, Gnana Yoga, that sequence.

1742
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
 All that I preach.

1743
00:06:25 --> 00:06:34
 But this one, you see, Kama Phalakyaaga means doing sacrifice of heart there in wealth.

1744
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
 Is it not?

1745
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
 Everybody does.

1746
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
 That is okay.

1747
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
 But in Gita there is one sloka.

1748
00:06:43 --> 00:06:59
 Actually, the word to be given to the devotee who does Kama Phalakyaaga.

1749
00:06:59 --> 00:07:07
 All the air and wealth when he donates, he is called as Kama Phalakyaaga.

1750
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
 There I got doubt.

1751
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
 This is not possible.

1752
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
 Especially in Kali Yuga this is not possible.

1753
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
 So this line of verse in Gita should be deleted from Gita for Kali Yuga.

1754
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
 Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga, Satchyaaga Chabhriyati.

1755
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
 Gnana Kama Phalakyaaga.

1756
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
 Better than meditation, Kama Phalakyaaga is better.

1757
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
 But Kama Phalakyaaga means Siddhasitthi and Thabhakti.

1758
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
 But there is another line in Gita.

1759
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
 Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga, Satchyaaga Chabhriyati.

1760
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
 Who does, who sacrifices all the air and wealth?

1761
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
 He is called as Kama Phalakyaaga.

1762
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
 Not everybody.

1763
00:07:57 --> 00:08:03
 Siddhasitthi Yadavati Shade, that itself is very difficult.

1764
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
 Because it is practical.

1765
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
 Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga, Sattuprastha, Turama.

1766
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
 Only two people I see.

1767
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
 I don't see any other third person.

1768
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
 Hardly to be counted on fingers.

1769
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
 Especially this Kalimba, Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga is not there.

1770
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
 But God Dakta gave me shock.

1771
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
 He produced Sarva Kama Phalakyaaga.

1772
00:08:35 --> 00:08:41
 He gave me shock.

1773
00:08:41 --> 00:08:49
 My concept, his concept is not having any example in the world.

1774
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
 No, this line, this Gita line.

1775
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
 You say that my concept has no example?

1776
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
 I will show you an example.

1777
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
 He is a creator.

1778
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
 He can create anything in his creation.

1779
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
 He created it.

1780
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
 Examples are these.

1781
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
 So I was shocked.

1782
00:09:17 --> 00:09:29
 I was similarly shocked when God Dakta explained me that Krishna's Navanita Chauriyam and Rasa Kriya are the chests of Eshnatrayam.

1783
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
 Then my mind was blocked for one month.

1784
00:09:33 --> 00:09:43
 Then this shock for the rest of my life and my mind was blocked.

1785
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
 And she is preparing for second night.

1786
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
 Please ask her to take some break. We are late.

1787
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
 That's what I am telling.

1788
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
 Already we are not completely relieved from the first shock.

1789
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
 Let us at least recover.

1790
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
 I promise, whatever you told I fulfilled.

1791
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
 I told all, not to tell anybody.

1792
00:10:11 --> 00:10:23
 You are very good.

1793
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
 We are all very happy.

1794
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
 We are also happy. Swami reminded us to leave early.

1795
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
 Yes, yes. Because we have to go home and...

1796
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
 Swami, one group photo.

1797
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
 Yes, come on.

1798
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
 One prayer, Swami.

1799
00:10:41 --> 00:10:51
 Udvegara hita Santoshara hita Shanti samudra Sri datta Shanti samudra Sri datta

1800
00:10:51 --> 00:11:03
 Shantiladhirbala tatvanyati Nirmikara jayalanta satchi Yogi raja gurupitha dheesha

 Om Shanti Shanti Shanti

1804
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
 Namaskar, Sir.

1805
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
 Namaste.

1806
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
 Thank you.
